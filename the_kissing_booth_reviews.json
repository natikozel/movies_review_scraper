      "text": "The director seemed to have a strange fascination with the lead taking off her shirt and wearing super short skirts, and the camera lingered on her in ways that made me uncomfortable.",

    {
      "text": "It feels like it was written by someone who simply digested everything she was told \"romance\" was supposed to be by the patriarchy, and vomited back at us. Nearly every clich√© in the film feels cribbed from another movie.",
      "author": "Ani Bundel"
    },
    {
      "text": "A smattering of swearing, sexual references and underage drinking means it doesn't patronise its intended audience, and it refreshingly allows the female lead to be the dork, rather than some unobtainable Venus.",
