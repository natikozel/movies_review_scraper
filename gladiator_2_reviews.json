    {
      "text": "If you’re paying attention, despite the copious gore, Denzel Washington having the time of his life as a scenery-chewing villain, and of course the sharks, you’ll leave the movie with a far deeper grasp of Rome as it actually was."

    },
    {
      "text": "Denzel Washington especially seems to be having a blast, hamming it up panto style as a plotting Iago-esque figure who steals every scene he’s in -- no mean feat considering how clunky the majority of the dialogue is. Solid, if overly broody."
    },
    {
      "text": "Gladiator II won’t have the lasting power of Gladiator. It’s a well-made & very entertaining sequel, but it’s chained to a hackneyed script. Scott proves that he still has the directorial expertise to turn average scripts into above-average movies though."
