      "text": "It isnâ€™t nonstop hilarity; there are quite a few dead spots. But I liked it a lot."

    {
      "text": "The teaming and the formula are often copied but rarely matched."
    },
    {
      "text": "What makes this fantasy of anti-social behaviour so painfully funny, is the gulf between etiquette and vulgarity, the desire to be a child whooping it up in the adult world."

    {
      "text": "You cannot deny a laugh, and Dumb and Dumber has plenty."
    },
    {
      "text": "...a modern classic of the comedy genre..."

    {
      "text": "The plot, of course, is merely an excuse for an endless series of gags, and the percentage of them that score is fairly high."
    },
    {
      "text": "From the puns to the slapstick to the toilet, Dumb and Dumber is performed at such a high level that it transcends many of its influences."
    },
    {
      "text": "Easily one of the funniest (and most quotable) movies ever made..."

    {
      "text": "The caviar of low-brow, gross-out comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Farrellys' knack for stupid, Three Stooges-esque comedy writ larger by an infusion of heart excels with the complementary screen teaming of manic Jim Carrey and consummate screen actor Jeff Daniels. [Blu-ray]"

    {
      "text": "...it tickles the funny bone often enough to merit serious consideration among lowbrow comedies."

    {
      "text": "[Featrues] a plethora of memorable scenes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Dumb and Dumber, which features Carrey and Jeff Daniels as nitwits traveling cross-country, is a frayed string of gags posing as a movie. Carrey, though, does literal-minded doofdom with peerless enthusiasm."
    },
    {
      "text": "This gleefully lowbrow film is best enjoyed by the young, and by those who can still laugh at the passing of gas."
    },
    {
      "text": "The wholeheartedness of this descent into crude and rude humor is so good-natured and precise that it's hard not to partake in the guilty pleasures of the exercise."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a long way from the social comedy of Jerry Lewis. The characters here are ultimately turned into punching bags or punch-line dispensers."

      "text": "Well titled and, for its purpose, a total success."

    {
      "text": "Gone are the days of John Belushi, where rudeness was raised to an art form."
    },
    {
      "text": "Given American cinema's current obsession with innocence and ignorance, at least this never romanticises its protagonists. They are genuinely, irredeemably, 100 per cent no-hopers."

    {
      "text": "A gross-out classic."

    {
      "text": "we can see a lot of these laughs coming, and they don't hold much staying power"

    {
      "text": "The funniest movie in the world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Released before I started reviewing, but I would be remiss if I didn't say: it's a fine film. Had me buckling over in laughter, often, little plot, 100% pure stupid genius."
    },
    {
      "text": "A movie that fully lives up to its name, right down to an opening credit sequence rife with intentional misspellings and grammatical errors."

      "text": "Dumb, but funny. Very funny."

      "text": "Despretensiosamente ingnuo, 'Dbi & Lide'  a maior prova de que um filme nem sempre precisa ter uma trama elaborada para agradar."
    },
    {
      "text": "Inspired, irreverent, spark-driven comedy that takes you places you never thought a movie would go -- even a Jim Carrey movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Carrey, I am now convinced, is a true original. In The Mask, he had the screenplay and production to back him up. Here, the filmmaking is more uncertain."
    },
    {
      "text": "Farrelly, quite simply put, does not appear to have the slightest clue about comic timing."
    },
    {
      "text": "An execrable catalogue of doody jokes, Dumb and Dumber is an abominable, abdominal comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Maybe it's indicative of my end-of-the-year brain-fry, but this dopey comedy about two of the dumbest guys in the universe on a road trip to misadventure is a hoot."
    },
    {
      "text": "While I won't claim to have gone through this entire film without laughing, there are some long periods between chuckles."
    },
    {
      "text": "This virtually laughless movie makes rude junior high school pranks seem positively sophisticated."
    },
    {
      "text": "An uneven collection of bodily function jokes, facial gyrations, sexual jibes and pedestrian slapstick."
