      "text": "Here’s a movie that’s aware of all its clichés, but somehow, with no limit of energy and humor, uses our awareness of these formulas as its strength."

    {
      "text": "While some original films make it through the cracks, almost everything these days is a sequel, reboot, or remake...our wallets are what do the talking and we keep rewarding Hollywood for this behavior."

      "text": "Despite all the coy formula-flipping and compulsive jokes, what wins us over is the odd-couple chemistry of the two leads."
    },

      "text": "To my surprise it turned out to be the big hulking anatomical joke-spewing genuine bromance-building raunchcom that could."
    },
    {
      "text": "A surprisingly strong film with a solid balance of humor and heart, actually making us feel for and identify with the characters rather than just go through the usual paces of an R-rated comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "It knows it is rather silly fluff, so it revels in its own raunchy silliness -- creating a comedy that delivers plenty of laughs."

      "text": "A surprisingly sharp film that mixes several genres together - and then subverts them all."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sure, references to \"Glee\" and Robert Downey Jr.'s drug years may not hold up quite as well in 20 years, but in an era of disposable pop culture, \"21 Jump Street\" is anything but, likely to be namechecked for a lot longer."

      "text": "... 21 Jump Street is consistently funny throughout, with a few really huge laughs peppered in the script."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not that the original series was high-brow/must-see television, but I figured any remake of it in the 21st century would at least be far more ambitious than this tired bit of recycling."

      "text": "Chaotic and far-fetched yet funny enough to have audiences rolling in the aisles."

    },
    {
      "text": "Because of Bacall's skill at writing great comedic material and Lord's and Miller's talent behind the camera, \"21 Jump Street\" became more than what it originally appeared to be, which is a surprise I'm always grateful for."
    },
    {
      "text": "21 Jump Street takes the basic concept of the original series, and uses it to create an action/comedy that is not only palatable to modern audiences, but appealing as well."
    },
    {
      "text": "Co-written, produced by, and stars Jonah Hill, who took exactly the right attitude towards the movie: He and his costar Channing Tatum embraced the stereotypes, laughed at themselves, and came up with a surprisingly funny film."

    },
    {
      "text": "...feels more like a guerrilla stunt than a soulless and cynical cash grab. Hooray for Hollywood, I guess."

      "text": "A raucous, entertaining, and incredibly funny film that respects the premise of the original series..."
    },
    {
      "text": "For an action comedy, \"21 Jump Street\" had less action or comedy than I expected. It felt as if I spent too much time waiting for something to happen-either for a joke to fire, or a pistol."
    },
    {
      "text": "The best thing that can be said for it is that it never coasts on just one type of joke; funny in execution, not just in concept."
    },
    {
      "text": "A floppy cross of high-school movie and buddy-cop comedy. Overdoses on flaccid penis and vagina 'jokes,' indulges in the ain't-this-cool?!ness of a cop-action flick, and passes out on the cliché-couch of bromance."

    },
    {
      "text": "t's less fun when the guns come out in the final act, but there's a moment late in the game that redeems the movie's predictable beats, before the whole thing dissolves into entropy and disorder."
    },
    {
      "text": "21 Jump Street is nothing like the original series. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and the strong beginning and ending do a pretty good job disguising the flabby middle. It's crass, self effacing, 'meta', stupidity and it works."
    },
    {
      "text": "Clever, profane and action-packed, '21 Jump Street' fairly leaps onto the big screen as one of the most enjoyable movies of the (still-admittedly young) year."
    },
    {
      "text": "A high-water mark for recent mainstream comedies. Consistently amusing and frequently uproarious."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raunchy and profane by design, nothing like the 80s TV show, nonetheless hilarious adult comedy - especially the first hour or so."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, some of the movie's funny bits were in the trailer. After all, they were trying to get you to buy a ticket. But, this is one of the rare comedies that delivers even more than promised."

    },
    {
      "text": "Lord and Miller mine the script... for plenty of profane laughs as they set up Hill and Tatum as a hilariously off-kilter comedy duo."
    },
    {
      "text": "...it doesn't help, either, that large chunks of the film have been improvised wholesale by the various actors, which only exacerbates the film's excessively slapdash feel."

      "text": "The late-eighties TV series is rebooted with jolts of sentiment, personal discovery, and wild comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "... latest in endless slew of painful spoofs based on TV shows takes an OK premise and milks it for an occasional chuckle before devolving into a succession of increasingly lame sketches."
    },
    {
      "text": "The humor squeezes just about all the giggle juice it can get out of the R rating. If you need a movie map, this 21 Jump Street is on the FAR side of town from Sesame Street."
    },
    {
      "text": "by no means a great comedy, but it does demonstrate that playing against the grain can be a good move, especially when the people in charge have run out of ideas"
    },
    {
      "text": "An unlikely (but funny) return to high school"
    },
    {
      "text": "It doesn't matter if you never saw the original, because this movie is a clever, fast-paced, action comedy..."
    },
    {
      "text": "A good-natured must-see for fans of broad, silly comedies with a little something under the surface too. Bright, breezy and brilliant."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is funny because it is pointed and smart, and it is also funny because it is unusually crass, but the chief takeaway here should be that it is funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rigorous planning likely was involved in taking the dumb concept of \"21 Jump Street\" and turning it into something that seems so effortlessly brilliant."
    },
    {
      "text": "While hardly raising the bar in action-comedy, it's still a fun, irreverent, laugh-out-loud take on the beloved, small-screen original."
    },
    {
      "text": "Halfway through this affable, inspired grab bag of a comedy, it hit me that what I was watching wasn't merely a good movie but the Greatest TV Adaptation Ever Made."
    },
    {
      "text": "I won't go so far as to say it's good, but 21 Jump Street is certainly better than it has any right to be."
    },
    {
      "text": "The humor may be coarse and crude but it is funny, and with these movies that is what counts."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's immature, rude and sometimes quite funny, at least until the same gag makes a fourth or fifth lap around the track."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has a tone all its own: drunk enough to lower the inhibitions; not so drunk that it becomes unintelligible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Funny and clever but ultimately dispiriting, with a finale that affirms the queasy wink-wink legalized bullying of its early police-vs.-citizens scenes, and that associates manhood with a willingness to kill with a gun -- all for a cheap laugh."
    },
    {
      "text": "21 Jump Street is as fresh and original a comedy you'll ever find that is based on a totally stolen concept. If only all Hollywood rip-offs could be this good."
    },
    {
      "text": "Strained and crass comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is entranced by male bonding, appendages and the chance to enact car chases, and but it's still a fairly filthy, funny flick that does nobody any harm."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's certainly preferable to any recent Johnny Depp vehicles."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's also loaded with a series of sidesplitting moments that seem to work on simple brute force."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Hill and Tatum] are well cast and rather good, as in a knowing way is Ice Cube as their parodically irascible superior."
    },
    {
      "text": "A scattershot hodgepodge of scatological and penile humor, \"21 Jump Street\" owes less to Johnny Depp's 1987 television launch pad series than it does to a mentality of lowest common denominator."
    },
    {
      "text": "A conscious two fingers to the old show's baby po-face."
    },
    {
      "text": "Maybe I'm just getting too old for this shit."
    },
    {
      "text": "The most immature R-rated movie I've ever seen. And I've seen all three Jackasses, but this is a good thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Overall \"21 Jump Street\" is an over the top action film with comedy that is not always perfect, but what is perfect is the blast this undercover adventure is!"
    },
    {
      "text": "The only thing you need to know about this cinematic remake of the 1980's television favorite 21 Jump Street is that it's funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "... Shows more imagination than most of today's original productions."
    },
    {
      "text": "It earns its laughs and never takes our affection for granted."
    },
    {
      "text": "What's most refreshing about the film is how it acknowledges its own narrative absurdities and retreaded tropes in a manner that's neither forced nor self-congratulatory."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"21 Jump Street\" is the funniest film of the year so far."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is smart, silly, straightforward, conceptual, satiric, raunchy, and character-based, all at once. I laughed often and I laughed hard."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hollywood is obsessed with strip-mining old TV shows and movies for remake fodder these days, but 21 Jump Street is an example of how it can be done well."
    },
    {
      "text": "tries to be both a comedy and an action film, but only succeeds as a comedy. It's extremely funny, with Hill and Tatum displaying a disturbing amount of chemistry."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rather than a re-hash of the original, though, this is a re-imagining by Hill, who ... set it in the present with appropriate nods to the original and a whole lot of silliness. Nostalgia has rarely been better served"
    },
    {
      "text": "Adheres to the rule that every TV show is subject to a cinematic rendering, regardless of the strength of its stories, appeal of its characters, or extent of its following."
    },
    {
      "text": "21 Jump Street on TV is a drama. The movie no way takes itself seriously. That helps. Lots. So does an R-rating where the characters are free to -- uh -- express themselves."
    },
    {
      "text": "A rude and raucous action comedy spoof, which turns the high-minded, message-laden original series on its head in order to poke fun at everything from Hollywood's desperate recycling of the past to the tired conventions of buddy-cop movies."
    },
    {
      "text": "Was it because 'The Dukes of Hazzard' and 'The A-Team' worked out so well for us?"
    },
    {
      "text": "This movie embraces everything that should make it lousy, calling out itself for aping the source's bad ideas then flipping the script with meta precision."
    },
    {
      "text": "TV-based buddy comedy is crude but hilarious."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tatum shows some range. Hill loses ground."
    },
    {
      "text": "A great cast, a surprisingly fresh and funny script, and the best non-explosion action scenes on film combine to make 21 Jump Street one of 2012's best comedies."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a fine screwball comedy in the old tradition...Ice Cube had me laughing out loud as the profane, angry boss of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tatum is absolutely hilarious in the movie and not in the unintentional way his stiff performances in romantic dramas like The Vow turn out to be."
    },
    {
      "text": "One might perceive \"21 Jump Street\" --- this version --- as strictly for adolescent boys. And yet, for once, I find it satisfyingly entertaining."
    },
    {
      "text": "It works primarily due to the expert comic timing of its two stars."
    },
    {
      "text": "It winds up indulging in some of the same buddy-cop cliches that it tries to lampoon."
    },
    {
      "text": "The whole crew makes clear its affections for action cinema, trashy television and the YouTube generation alike while having fun at the expense of all three."
    },
    {
      "text": "Other than a few cracks here and there, this particular \"Street\" is one fun ride."
    },
    {
      "text": "The idea to play the concept for laughs is an inspired one, and Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum mine the material for all the crass, R-rated comedy that it's worth."
    },
    {
      "text": "The twist that makes this somewhat ragged comedy work as well as it does is that the two cops revert to the level of high-school immaturity as they blend in with the genuine teens around them."
    },
    {
      "text": "This bracing new take on 21 Jump Street has a playful spark all its own. It's a blast."
    },
    {
      "text": "It does contain several moments that do not seem to realize this and provide some unexpectedly big laughs at the oddest moments."
    },
    {
      "text": "Most importantly, it acknowledges how lame reboots are by nature, and how rarely they honor the original."
    },
    {
      "text": "I am ashamed at how much I laughed at this movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Filthy, sweary, sweet and very funny all at the same time."
    },
    {
      "text": "A deliciously foul-mouthed buddy movie that rides roughshod over political correctness."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are an inspired duo."
    },
    {
      "text": "A try-anything, fitfully amusing muddle that wears its mocking cynicism a bit too proudly."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is rude, speedy and outrageous, and we mean that in the best way."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"21\" makes clear from the beginning it is gobbling up some pop culture refuse in the name of nothing more than making fun of it and having fun with it."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is the funniest movie I've seen in more than a year."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"21 Jump Street\" might be yet another product of Hollywood's recycling program, but it deserves to be noticed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Here's a film that's far cleverer than it needs to be, and for that reason alone, we should be grateful."
    },
    {
      "text": "Perfect blend of action and comedy that doubles as a satire of teen culture and TV to film adaptations. Hill and Tatum are superb leads. Hilarious and fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "As remakes of '80s properties go, you'd be hard pressed to find one so self-deprecating, yet ruthless."
    },
    {
      "text": "Eventually, the film does run out of comic steam. But I'd say for 90 percent of its running time, the action and the comedy mix hums along at a terrific pace. This is a real surprise. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
    },
    {
      "text": "For its first half this movie does a reasonably clever job of reinvention, though the crudeness level is excessive; but the second half jumps the rails."
    },
    {
      "text": "Loose and meandering, but it also knows how and when to entertain."
    },
    {
      "text": "Funny and smarter than it has any right to be."
    },
    {
      "text": "21 Jump Street is another re-hash of a largely forgotten Eighties television series - but it's surprisingly enjoyable."
    },
    {
      "text": "A hit-and-miss hodgepodge of plotting and jokes redolent at least as often of desperation as of inspiration."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tatum, best known for syrupy romances and action movies, turns out to have crackerjack comic timing and Brie Larson and Dave Franco are standouts."
    },
    {
      "text": "Miller and Lord clearly understand the push-and-pull and hyper-competitiveness that make guy friendships both complex and stupid."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's that rare comedy that's funny throughout, with a hilarious story that hinges on the unlikely pairing of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum."
    },
    {
      "text": "The basic premise -- that these two are supposed to be high school age and siblings -- is funny, but the joke, as is true of many others in this movie, is replayed way too often."
    },
    {
      "text": "Overlong, but against the odds the usually wooden Channing Tatum is the comedy standout."
    },
    {
      "text": "21 Jump Street makes a virtue of low expectations, like an underachieving high school burnout coasting on his modest reserves of charm."
    },
    {
      "text": "Against all odds, 21 Jump Street is an immensely enjoyable, frequently hilarious film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frenetic and loud can be funny on its own. But it requires either the finesse to be smart about playing stupid or sheer, balls-out craziness. Disappointingly, this has a hard time choosing between destinations and takes too long to find its way."
    },
    {
      "text": "This cheerfully chaotic, gleefully vulgar action-comedy retread of the old television series has box-office success written all over it, and where's the harm? It's irresistibly funny until it isn't."
    },
    {
      "text": "In its outrageous way, 21 Jump Street has real laughs."
    },
    {
      "text": "It was inevitable that one of Hollywood's many recent reboots would eventually attain sentience. Hence the arrival of 21 Jump Street, a film that not only knows it's a remake, but knows how absurd it has to be to succeed as a remake."
    },
    {
      "text": "Against all odds, \"21 Jump Street\" is actually pretty funny and lifts movie comedy out of its recent creative rut."
    },

      "text": "Neither man has had a better foil. They are literally and figuratively trying to bring something out of each other, and they do."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's no tribute to the original program, but a wink-happy perversion of the concept, raising hell in its own somewhat tedious, frequently hilarious way."
    },
    {
      "text": "This film is even better if you come in with no spoilers and low expectations, so we will build it up no more."
    },
    {
      "text": "...a ridiculous amount of fun when screenwriter Michael Bacall (of the loathsome \"Project X\") isn't confusing crassness with comedy."

      "text": "This potty-mouthed and drug-laced reimagining of the 1980s TV show has one of the highest laughs-per-minute ratios since the Naked Gun films."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's not just a nostalgia-peddling cash-grab, offering raucous laughs contained in a jubilant male-bonding storyline."

      "text": "Make no mistake, there is a fresh, focused and undeniably funny comedic sensibility that stays to the fore throughout."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tatum and Hill steamroller any misgivings right from the start. They take a comedy connection that seemed doomed to fail - pairing Tatum's hunky command with Hill's nerdy neediness - and make it look like the most natural thing in the world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tatum in particular is a huge surprise. He's always been a pretty face, but here (as in his recent SNL outing) he displays comedic chops we never saw coming."

      "text": "The comedy revels in putting dumb and/or inept spins on cinematic formulas. It results in a shoddy movie, but one that is bad in rather interesting ways."
    },
    {
      "text": "The makers of 21 Jump Street clearly understood that almost nobody really wanted a 21 Jump Street movie, and they've cleverly used a familiar property as a way to get a wildly entertaining new comedy made."

They trade in their guns and badges for backpacks, and set out to shut down a dangerous drug ring. But, as time goes on, Schmidt and Jenko discover that high school is nothing like it was just a few years earlier -- and, what's more, they must again confront the teenage terror and anxiety they thought they had left behind.",
