      "text": "... as some of those Axis Powers rear their heads up in America, seeking to take control as shouts of America First grow louder once more, a film like \"Casablanca\" can remind audiences of what happens when even the most jaded of us take up arms once more."

    {
      "text": "“Casablanca” captures and utilizes so many things well. There’s a high level of suspense. There’s a touch of humor. There is a great realization of wartime tensions. And right in the middle of it all is what may be the best romance in cinema history."
    },
    {
      "text": "Casablanca, in fact, is starry with talent, pictorially often lovely and directed with considerable spirit by Michael Curtiz."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's far from a great film, but it has a special appealingly schlocky romanticism, and you're never really pressed to take its melodramatic twists and turns seriously."
    },
    {
      "text": "As soon as the main titles end, you are transported into a world filled with great performances and an incredibly sophisticated screenplay that takes advantage of every emotion you can think of."
    },
    {
      "text": "It continues to fascinate audiences in a way that is beyond explanation, except to resolve that the picture seems to result from and fully encompass that somewhat fantastical notion of Movie Magic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Casablanca is as ineffectual as a Collier’s short story, but with one thing and another -- like Bergman, Veidt and Humphrey Bogart -- it is a pleasure of sorts."
    },
    {
      "text": "The plot is complicated in detail but clear in its issue; and it is in the presentation of the tortuous means by which the desperately-desired end is gained that the picture succeeds admirably."
    },
    {
      "text": "So topical is the dialogue that it might have been written yesterday, instead of six months ago."
    },
    {
      "text": "Some movies just have the perfect script, packed full of endlessly quotable lines that are effortlessly delivered by an extraordinary cast. A phenomenal movie, that everyone needs to have seen."

      "text": "Dooley Wilson gets his best screen role to date as Rick's piano player, and comes through with ease."
    },
    {
      "text": "Casablanca walks a thin line between classic romance and cheesy, but it stays true to its course. It could have very easily steered right into cheesy and stayed there, but because Curtiz had a vision it doesn't go there."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is an occasion where the final whole seriously and decisively outweighs the sum of its flawed, imperfect parts. Screenwriter Koch lived up to his pledge to \"develop a serious melodrama of present-day significance.\""

      "text": "The classic pairing of Bogie and Bergman..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is excitingly acted, smartly directed, and tells a story crammed with suspense, characterization and action. The cast of players is enough to fill the theatre alone, for it includes some of the finest players Hollywood has to boast about."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a war picture that is not about the war so much as it is about people, just people who find themselves pocketed by one or another set of war circumstances."
    },
    {
      "text": "Warners have been generous in fitting fine players to roles that become gems, each in its own way, through the incisive handling of Claude Rains, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson, S. Z. Sakall and Joy Page."
    },
    {
      "text": "Claude Rains, as a French captain whose sympathies do not jibe with his uniform of allegiance to Nazi rule, gives a grand performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Casablanca won't let you down, not too much anyway. It's a good melodrama, slightly overrated perhaps, but still good to the last drop. Especially the last drop."

    },
    {
      "text": "Apparently Casablanca, which I must say I liked, is working up a rather serious reputation as a fine melodrama. Why? It is obviously an improvement on one of the world's worst plays; but it is not such an improvement that that is not obvious."
    },
    {
      "text": "The tale as unfolded is one of love, hate, revenge and gallantry and will please those who watch its visualization because of its fine reserve during most of its telling."

      "text": "The whole thing is exciting, first-class entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the hands of this cast and the capable direction of Curtiz. the film remains absorbing throughout, where lesser players might have made it seems slow-moving. The picture lacks action, but never drama."
    },
    {
      "text": "Casablanca in the days before the allied occupation had obvious possibilities as the background of a film of intrigue and adventure, and the film... has taken at least a reasonable percentage of its opportunities."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Casablanca Is fast-moving, and the intrigue between the Germans and the French holds attention, with plenty of dramatic high spots, it is the individual performances that give the picture its real distinction."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is a careful opulence about the production which should redound to the credit of Hal B. Wallis and of Michael Curtiz, who directed."
    },
    {
      "text": "While the exceptional performances of Bogart and Bergman are highlighted, Henreid and Greenstreet deserve their share of praise and Rains comes across with a supporting role of Academy Award proportions."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a busy film, with bright lines, a perfunctory romance, and a dim message, that you can't escape from yourself, or something. Most people however, will let the message alone and just enjoy themselves with the mechanics of escape."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has exciting story to unfold - and it does at a tempo that allows no slackening of suspense; It has a solid quota of romance, plenty of skilful characterisation, a fair issue of comedy, and, into the bargain, it has the exotic background of Casablanca."
    },
    {
      "text": "A brilliant and moving melodrama."
    },
    {
      "text": "Humphrey Bogart is grand. Ingrid Bergman is poignantly and dramatically beautiful. Henreid is quietly convincing as are Conrad Veidt and the rest of the notable cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "As an excellent though melodramatic background to today's stirring headlines of the \"second front\" in North Africa, Casablanca is as topical a film as has ever been made."

      "text": "Timely in title and topic, Casablanca is an excellent war melodrama, one that will certainly appeal to all types of audiences."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's probably high time for a \"Casablanca\" remake. It debuted in 1943 to awaken apathetic America to the Nazi threat. Now, the Chinese Communist Party is hell-bent on world domination-somebody hurry up and discover the new Bogart and Bergman!"

    },
    {
      "text": "Where most other war-time melodramas have pinned their faith upon breakneck action, [Casablanca] derives its superb strength from the clashes and interplay of character [and] Michael Curtiz's highly disciplined handling of the suspense."
    },
    {
      "text": "Casablanca is one of the most exciting melodramas the screen has ever produced. And it is mature, intelligently conceived, and, within the limits of melodrama, honest."
    },
    {
      "text": "Moments of high tension and suspense punctuate the action with the most thrilling moment when in Rick's cafe a group of Free French men drown out Nazi voices by singing the \"Marseillaise.\" Picture is acted with distinction by a fine cast."

    },
    {
      "text": "There is less gunplay than is usual in such narratives, and the story is, indeed, no more than adequate, but any lack of excitement is more than balanced by excellent characterisation and quite brilliantly sensitive acting."

      "text": "While the future was uncertain, the resolute characters of this exquisite wartime drama found peace through love and resistance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Certainly a more accomplished cast of players cannot be imagined, and their direction by Michael Curtiz is inspired."
    },
    {
      "text": "Curtiz's film is a classic for a reason -- it's crafted with the precision, detail and beauty of a Fabergé egg; the dialogue is hauntingly memorable and, in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, it has one of the most magnetic screen pairings in history."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "There are some of the very finest character actors that Warner Brothers could muster and a rich, detailed screenplay studded with an indecent number of sparklingly quotable lines. It is a movie to play again, and again."

      "text": "Nobody lights a torch like Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa or carries one like Humphrey Bogart's Rick."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "The film's tensions, sexual and dramatic, derive from the ambiguity of characters' motives. We can never be too sure about Rick and Renault until the final fadeout."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Its undying appeal may be the result of the Hollywood factory's skill, in those days, in fashioning something memorable out of virtually nothing."

    {
      "text": "It is the product of numerous accidents, all of them happy, and I laugh, cry and have my better instincts appealed to whenever I see it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bogart, as might be expected, is more at ease as the bitter and cynical operator of a joint than as a lover, but handles both assignments with superb finesse. Bergman, in a torn-between-love-and-duty role, lives up to her reputation as a fine actress."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is one of the most timeless of all movies in terms of topic, emotion, acting and motivation."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a reason the world loves this wartime film, now digitally restored: more memorable dialogue than should be strictly legal, heartbreaking performances from the two leads and a plot that works with Swiss-watch precision."

      "text": "It is a true timeless classic and will stay so as long as time goes by."
    },
    {
      "text": "Part of what makes this wartime Hollywood drama (1942) about love and political commitment so fondly remembered is its evocation of a time when the sentiment of this country about certain things appeared to be unified."
    },
    {
      "text": "Since it screened at the theater in 1943, the story of lovers Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) in Casablanca has made cinematic history."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the best screenplays ever filmed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its complex propagandist subtexts and vision of a reluctantly martial America's 'stumbling' morality still intrigue, just as Bogart's cult reputation among younger viewers still obtains."
