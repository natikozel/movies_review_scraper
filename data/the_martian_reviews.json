      "text": "Welcome back, Sir Ridley Scott. The Martian was easily one of my favorite blockbusters of the year, a film crowded with a stunning cast in which everyone is given their due."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a piece of sweeping populist entertainment, The Martian is a great success, despite a couple of issues that perturb throughout."
    },
    {
      "text": "Damon has always had a knack for playing ordinary but determined men, and this quality is ideal for the role he has here: a Robinson Crusoe on the red planet."
    },
    {
      "text": "This entertaining mixture of striking visuals and patient, methodical narrative has little in common with Scottâ€™s past sci-fi experiences."
    },
    {
      "text": "A crowd-pleaser, complete with several disco songs on the kitschy soundtrack and a predictably applaud-worthy climax."
    },
    {
      "text": "While The Martian honors the common good and the value of a single human life, I also reflected on the fictional worldwide effort it took to bring Watney home."
    },
    {
      "text": "A sci-fi movie heavy on science but even heavier on the abilities of the human mind to work through any situation presents."
    },
    {
      "text": "The best blockbuster of the year arrived later than anticipated."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian somehow made the intricacies of growing crops in space exciting, continuing the trend of excellent science fiction that leaned heavily into the science."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ridley Scott and Matt Damon team up for a space-based drama that'll make you chuckle."
    },
    {
      "text": "A fun film, a space Western about the strength of the human spirit and the indomitable will. \"Interstellar\" tread similar thematic ground last year but did so without the humour, the cheesy 70's soundtrack or, most importantly, Matt Damon."
    },
    {
      "text": "It seems to understand that the quotidian of life in space as a lone man attempts to survive is as fascinating as any storm or explosion."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is exactly the reason why we watch movies. It's fun, exciting, and a thrilling spectacle with deep emotional payoffs and strong performances from its all-star cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "Matt Damon's strong central performance anchors this compelling sci-fi adventure about a man stuck on Mars while the folks back home try to find an easy way to rescue him."
    },
    {
      "text": "When the bits of suspense arrive, they're handled with Scott's veteran expertise and Damon's sensational screen presence."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Damon] is supported by a top-flight cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Aksel Hennie..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The screenplay, unhappily, has retained the general flatness of the scenes on Earth...Scott has a number of talented performers at his disposal, who struggle to make something of the oddly colorless and often drama-less dialogue..."
    },
    {
      "text": "An epic space adventure, a story of one man's determination, fighting for survival in the most hostile environment imaginable, an effects-driven tentpole, a small human story, and much more."

      "text": "It was fun, it was fluffy, it was entertaining, but I didn't think it was a great movie."

      "text": "The Martian is a story about people working together but thinking for themselves. It is also a first class piece of cinematic entertainment..."

      "text": "The Martian is the movie we need right now."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is a major return to form for Scott, who seems inspired by NASA's can-do spirit."
    },
    {
      "text": "Watney may be taking a bunch of giant steps for mankind, but The Martian merely tiptoes around other great films that take on a similar topic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian consumes audiences from start to finish. Damon's witty performance makes the film both fun and intense while Scott's balance of Mars, Earth, emotion, politics, science and humor is an impressive and enthralling feat."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The Martian\" is this decade's \"Cast Away,\" but if \"Cast Away\" took place in a world that was constantly plugged in and online."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is that rare film that both thrills and inspires, so much so that i'm sure it will be seen repeatedly at the theater and at home for years to come."
    },
    {
      "text": "I can't see fans of the book (myself included) being remotely disappointed and imagine newcomers will be equally as enamoured."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Gravity was a mediation on the choice to survive, The Martian is a celebration of our ability to survive no matter what, even when we should very much be dead."
    },
    {
      "text": "Scott manages to take potentially dry scientific ideas and turns it into thrilling cinematic gold."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is the unique kind of blockbuster that you can marvel at in awe while still maintaining an emotional connection. It truly does have it all."

    {
      "text": "The Martian is a film that is driven and well-rounded family entertainment that is sure to please everyone and maybe make them want to go pick up a science book."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is ultimately a love letter to the spirit that saw humanity reach for the stars in the first place. When it's channelling that spirit via Damon and witty writing it lifts off, but then can't quite sustain its trajectory."
    },
    {
      "text": "Definitely my favorite live action film of the year."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian won't please those expecting a dark, terrorizing thrill ride where the heroes are in constant peril, but it'll make the rest of us laugh and cheer, which is something sci-fi blockbusters don't do enough these days."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ridley Scott returns to demonstrate that he is a great science fiction storyteller. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "A hugely entertaining movie about the scientific ingenuity of man while coping with the age-old dangers of abandonment and isolation. Despite coming in at 144 minutes it doesn't feel long at all (or maybe I'm just still on Mars time)."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is a crowdpleaser, hopefully one that may inspire the next generation of space explorations."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's breezy and fun, and director Ridley Scott makes the most of his talented cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is that rarest of aliens - a movie that is a heartfelt celebration of what science can accomplish, wrapped in purest entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hopefully, The Martian is not dismissed as a foreign alien in the minds of ardent movie-going SF enthusiasts looking for a realistic and soulful space-age adventure with a refreshing backbone of scientific curiosity and candidness."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is a pleasant and heartwarming surprise as both a science-fiction film and a Ridley Scott film."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a brave, new world that looks a lot like our current world, just with a whole lot more red sand."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is a finely shot, extremely well-acted film that is so by-the-numbers I hope to never see it again. In fact, I think I'd rather be stranded on Mars."
    },
    {
      "text": "A kind of Saving Private Ryan in space."
    },
    {
      "text": "Entertaining and visually appealing though it is, The Martian lacks one key element: characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "I saw Ridley Scott's new film The Martian last night and loved every moment of it-well, almost every moment of it."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The Martian\" is exactly what you expect it to be: tense, humorous and dramatic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Matt Damon could make a career out of playing marooned astronauts and I would be totally fine with that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Maybe the film is so bright because the days are thirty-nine minutes longer on Mars than on Earth, the same thirty-nine minutes that should have been cut from this Friday-less Robinson Crusoe."
    },
    {
      "text": "Scott only gets it half right, but the science lecture up to the go-for-broke finale, is scintillating in its own cerebral right."
    },
    {
      "text": "In an era of \"look at me\" CGI fireworks, here's a movie with a \"let's work together\" emphasis on problem-solving and teamwork."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rarely has a movie felt more sketched out on the back of a napkin. It is riddled with distracting continuity errors and puzzles, including the undying question: what is a botanist even doing on Mars?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is fantastic and a great return to form for Ridley Scott. He stages the film around the theme of survival and man's willingness to defy death, which ultimately winds up uplifting"
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, The Martian, which is based on a novel by Andy Weir, covers pretty familiar science-fiction ground, but the execution is marvellous."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is not self-serious, and is a reminder that you can make a movie with real stakes, depth, and tension and still include humor-it does not have to be one or the other (I'm looking at you, Christopher Nolan)."
    },
    {
      "text": "... this bloated by mostly entertaining chunk of shameless American triumphalism casts Matt Damon as Mark Watney..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is its own worst enemy: the good stuff at the beginning makes the run-of-the-mill stuff seem worse than it is."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian never loses sight of the fact that it is about a supreme test of will and intelligence and human triumph."
    },
    {
      "text": "To watch The Martian is to witness the development of one man's pedagogy of what it means to exist in the universe."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian would be a great engineering recruitment film - if it ever mentioned the word 'engineering.'"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is a movie about hope, and there isn't one moment in the entire film where you aren't hoping along with Watney that he'll get home safe."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ridley Scott handles the planetary and space sequences beautifully, especially an action-packed climax that will have you on the edge of your seat."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the nearest most of us will get to feeling like we've lived on Mars for an eternity. And that's not saying a lot."
    },
    {
      "text": "Packed with as much science-fact as it is with science-fiction, The Martian is a hugely ambitious story told with genuine heart. Matt Damon delivers a knockout performance, and this film marks Ridley Scott finally getting back to his best form."
    },
    {
      "text": "As pure numbers-game suspense, the movie passes inspection, but the relative absence of soul searching... makes it seem a specious vehicle for the trumpeting of such human values as cooperation, perseverance, and self-sacrifice."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Weir's story, which screenwriter Drew Goddard adapted for Scott, may not be particularly profound -- we're not talking Blade Runner here, after all -- it is memorable. Which just shows you what a little attitude can accomplish."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a little corny, of course, but a little corn can be good for the soul. You leave The Martian thinking that maybe the problems here on Earth aren't so bad after all."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is a film about human error, the will to survive, and the responsibility that we have as human beings, not just to the work that we dedicate our lives to, but to one another as people."
    },
    {
      "text": "A half-hour into The Martian any seasoned moviegoer can figure out where the plotline in this feel-good movie has to go. That's a shame and the film's biggest transgression."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is at once a thoughtful, witty, intelligent, tense, and emotional experience, as beautiful in presentation as it is delightful in spirit."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite being marketed under the mainstream bait of a \"space movie,\" The Martian is, more than anything, a love letter to science, without ever feeling like a boring textbook."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's true geek entertainment, not just in the sense that it's science fiction, but because it's about a group of smart, competent characters solving problems that pan out like lethal brain teasers."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Ridley Scott and screenwriter Drew Goddard have managed to turn a series of math equations into exciting filmed entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "... the rare science fiction drama that is actually built on applied physics and engineering and organic chemistry and where survival depends on creative problem solving and teamwork across millions of miles."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sir Ridley Scott's The Martian is a thoroughly entertaining epic that easily ranks as one of the best films of 2015, and as the director's best film since 2000's Gladiator."
    },
    {
      "text": "I have no idea if the science in The Martian is accurate. It sure felt accurate, which is all that matters in a way. On top of being wildly entertaining, the film is about using your wits to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds."
    },
    {
      "text": "You may discover hearing songs that normally provoke in you a knee-jerk flailing at whatever source is playing them ('Turn it off!!!') will here make you feel strangely happy."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is to moviegoers of today what 2001: A Space Odyssey was to audiences in 1968.... But Scott's rendition is more light-hearted and nerdy, and he clearly relishes every minute of the project."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is racked with clichÃ©s, but largely because of Damon's presence as a compact ball of energy and optimism, The Martian ends up a passably impressive tale of survival, fired with a curious mix of thrill and humour."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's just a cracklingly good entertainment, a crowd-pleaser that's compelling and emotional and even a little inspirational."
    },
    {
      "text": "The interplanetary tech geek gardening thriller of the year."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm so glad the filmmakers let Watney let his nerd flag fly, and I hope this movie will inspire other filmmakers to do the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "The most colossally mediocre sci-fi movie of the decade, all in pursuit of empty backslapping and a grade school level celebration of science."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian marks a huge, and much-needed, achievement for Scott and for Damon, whose part further cements his status as one of the biggest actors today."
    },
    {
      "text": "Here's a space travel epic that digs deep into technicalities and still manages to be tremendously thrilling and fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like Tom Hanks before him and Leonardo DiCaprio, Damon doesn't shrink from the burden of being alone onscreen for so much of the film-he owns it...."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an adventure, pure and simple, in the tradition of Robinson Crusoe and Gulliver. And every bit as timeless."
    },
    {
      "text": "I like my \"alone in space\" movies to be far weirder and more cerebral than The Martian. Scott or Damon can stay on Mars; fly me to to Sam Rockwell and the Moon or directly into the Sun with Danny Boyle."
    },
    {
      "text": "When it comes time for the inevitable 'triumph-of-the-human-spirit' that necessitates this regurgitated survival narrative, all that computes is smugness and nationalism."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sci-fi is withouth a doubt the genre in which Ridley Scott feels at his most comfortable, and he finally delivers an entertaining movie worthy of his caliber, even if it's not a masterpiece. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The biggest surprise in Ridley Scott's latest film, The Martian , is that Damon is very funny, in a movie that you wouldn't have expected to have any laughs. So if you've been put off"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian may be light, but it's a fun ride out of this world."
    },
    {
      "text": "A rollicking space procedural that depends on some logic, and a great deal of luck."
    },
    {
      "text": "Probably The Martian proves to be an entertaining popcorn movie that pleases general audiences but is beyond of being as good as Alien and Blade Runner. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The ending is so farfetched that the suspension of disbelief dies long before anyone in the film ever does."
    },
    {
      "text": "Will eventually find itself planted amongst the best in Ridley Scott's bulging anthology as it is perfectly paced, visually stunning, and mentally challenging"
    },
    {
      "text": "Charming and exciting without ever losing sight of its tale of humanity, and science."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian pushes the right emotional buttons and is a crowd-pleaser."
    },
    {
      "text": "This stranded-astronaut movie can't muster all that much drama. Watney's crewmates just can't convey much emotion; Watney mostly emits smart-ass movie lines. NASA's tech and its astronauts' gutsiness and smarts are glorified to the point of porn-iness."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the title Robinson Crusoe on Mars hadn't already been snagged... it would be a perfect fit for Ridley Scott's space epic, which maroons Matt Damon's astronaut on the red planet and then shows him using Crusoe-like ingenuity in a bid to survive."
    },
    {
      "text": "...an often potent sci-fi drama that benefits substantially from Damon's almost impossible charismatic performance..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift. Would any other actor have shouldered the weight of the role with such diligent grace?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Fascinating, feel-good and quite simply a hugely fun reason to head to the cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "If Damon manages to get into the awards fray for this role -- and he should -- it will be thanks to the fact that he makes it easy to understand how a desperate man could still find a way to laugh."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite following fast in the warp drive of Gravity, Interstellar and Scott's own Prometheus, this fabulously entertaining film doesn't suffer either through space fatigue or by comparison."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sci-fi maestro Ridley Scott is in his element employing the 3D format to dazzlling effect."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's pretty sunny and often funny, a space oddity for a director not known for pictures with a sense of humor."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is entertaining not because of how it ends, which you can probably guess, but from watching a whole bunch of really smart people figure out how to get there."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of Ridley Scott's better films in years features one of Matt Damon's best performances."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian takes all the romance out of Mars, but substitutes in its place science, cooperation, and human perseverance. Fair bargain."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is one of the films of the year so far."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite a lack of psychological depth, The Martian succeeds as a tribute to humanity's collective resolve."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is the kind of sci-fi movie I've been wanting for a long time-one where science takes center stage and the wondrous, awe-inspiring things that happen all stem from people solving problems using their brains, working collaboratively."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is a brilliantly designed entertainment that combines all the intricacies of good speculative fiction with a surprisingly lighthearted tone of survival."
    },
    {
      "text": "With The Martian, director Ridley Scott and star Matt Damon deliver an almost perfect piece of popular filmmaking, an intimate sci-fi epic that is smart, spectacular and stirring."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Martian is an all-American movie about complicated problems that has no deep emotional complications whatsoever, and though that would normally kill a movie for me, Scott and Damon make it an exhilarating experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character's solo ordeal -- at one point, scraggly Watney calls himself a \"space pirate\" -- Damon is the key to the movie's exuberance."
    },
    {
      "text": "As the movie celebrates the astronaut's industry and intelligence (and the smarts of his NASA colleagues), it offers a riposte to the shortsightedness and science-denying attitudes of those unwilling to invest in solutions to the Earth's own dilemmas."
    },
    {
      "text": "It isn't perfect, but The Martian is a triumph. From sound design to the visuals to watching the problem-solving unfold, it is astounding."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "This is still a very nerdy movie, with lots of botany and physics and \"we ran the numbers and it checks out,\" but most of the book's wonkiness is ironed out in favor of moving the story along more pleasingly for the science-allergic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The humor and Damon's normal-guy qualities -- despite being a genius scientist -- make living on Mars all the more relatable to us. He and others also make math look cool. Geeks rule in this movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it boasts plenty of amazing effects and wide open vistas to justify its apportionment of IMAX screens, the film -- featuring a droll Matt Damon in the title role -- is a celebration of science, selflessness and good old-fashioned smarts."
