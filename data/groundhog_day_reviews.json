      "text": "Chicago connections are many for the Bill Murray classic that’s funny, poignant and way better than sweet vermouth on the rocks, with a twist."
    },
    {
      "text": "As home releases and re-releases start to fall into a bit of an endless cycle, it makes a weird bit of sense that Groundhog Day would lack a certain excitement and feel like more of what we’ve seen, yet still bring about a little bit of joy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nothing suggested that this would gather steam over time and emerge as one of the most respected comedies of the past 30 years."
    },
    {
      "text": "This delightful romantic comedy, directed by Harold Ramis, is rich in fantasy and unexpectedly funny twists."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is a Scrooge-like comedy that's surprisingly delightful. It poses a very interesting question: What would happen if every day were the same?"
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a purity to Groundhog Day that we rarely see in movies... It's civilized, as well as the perfect entertainment of the moment."
    },
    {
      "text": "This sweetly surrealist comedy is, arguably, Murray's most irresistible effort. Groundhog Day is a warm and rewarding story about reason, reckoning, and romance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Harold Ramis handles the situation beautifully. A potentially silly premise takes on Capraesque qualities and delights."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day could have been a dull one-joke film, but Murray and Ramis make it work by doggedly pursuing the implications of their outlandish premise."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is without doubt the wittiest Bill Murray film ever, filled with verbal, physical and even thematic gags that satisfy on several levels simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is a charming and hilarious film. Or did I already say that? Anyway, it is worth repeating."
    },
    {
      "text": "What [Bill Murray] really wants is to be corny. He achieves his goal in this amusing, sentimental, sometimes slack but thoroughly entertaining comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day might have been a mere gimmick movie, but it isn't; it's something better -- a gentle fantasy of both paralysis and liberation."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is a fresh and inventive film filled with laughs and thought-provoking ideas. I loved it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Occasionally, Groundhog Day buries its head in dumb-comedy clichés. But the film-makers have depended mostly on witty dialogue, and on the simple elegance of the premise -- which could be about anyone whose days all start to seem the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is an exceptionally sparky film. It uses the medium of cinema as only cinema can be used -- to re-edit reality. It restores a fresh breath of fantasy to the generally stale air of the sitcom world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is an intriguing fable that almost overstays its welcome but never quite folds up under scrutiny."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even at its most negligible, Harold Ramis' film is intensely cinematic, not because he is some kind of genius director -- he's not -- but because in the end it's down to film language whether the hero is in hell or in heaven."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day combines Saturday Night Live shtick with Twilight Zone weirdness, and when it works, it's hilarious... Two-thirds of the way through, however, Groundhog Day turns syrupy, ruining much of the fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is the best vehicle for his brand of silly psychosis since Murray tangled with that pesky gopher in Caddyshack. It's a novel, fanciful comedy premise that sails over any shortcomings because it lets Murray be Murray."
    },
    {
      "text": "Murray's success here is also the film's undoing. This is his vehicle, and the rest of the cast, as well as the town itself, becomes his straight man."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's unlikely anyone but the maniacal Murray could have pulled this film off. He is one of the few actors around who can crack up an audience just lying alone in bed -- asleep."
    },
    {
      "text": "From a single dramatic idea familiar to readers of science fiction, Ramis and his co-writer Danny Rubin have fashioned an inventive, discreetly moral comedy of ideas that encourages you to think as you laugh."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day goes nowhere very slowly."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day has few side-splitting moments, but contains a steady diet of small laughs. It is also the first film for Mr. Murray that thoroughly combines his comedic talents with romantic situations."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is not a comedy classic. But it should make you laugh. In these days of unfunny humor and hilarious drama, that's no small feat. With or without practice."
    },
    {
      "text": "That it works so entertainingly is a tribute to an ingenious script -- which gradually turns the film into an unconventional romantic comedy and, almost miraculously, never runs out of steam -- and to a pair of very likable performances."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is clearly fashioned after those Frank Capra fables of the '40s in which everyone finally learns a lesson about human nature, but the screenplay smartly balances the sentimentality with cynicism."
    },
    {
      "text": "Unlike many of today's forced, effects-heavy comedies, Groundhog Day has an easy, natural feeling. It's probably a sign of maturity in Ramis and Murray that they work together so effortlessly and winningly."
    },
    {
      "text": "Kafka meets Capra as Ramis inventively seizes the abundant comic opportunities of this marvelous premise, resulting in a moving and mesmerizing cross between It's A Wonderful Life and an episode of television's The Twilight Zone."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ramis has always been a smart comedy writer, but his direction is a revelation. After directing the simplistic Caddyshack, no one would have foreseen such a smooth, confident, comedy gem."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite miscastings in the main roles (Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell) and an off-putting title, this is an engagingly inventive romantic comedy about déjà vu."
    },
    {
      "text": "Murray's goofy frat-boy persona serves him well as he takes us through Phil's fuming, fighting and, finally, reformation."
    },
    {
      "text": "The repetition and predictability of Groundhog Day is its biggest drawback, though it's often overcome by the likability and freshness of Bill Murray's performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "With Bill Murray delivering the most mature performance of his career, it has a romantic charm to match its freshness and its constant good humor."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the film doesn't cross the line into inspired lunacy, the laughs are plentiful."
    },
    {
      "text": "Murray has captured something that the other baby-boom comics have not -- an edge of anxiety beneath the self-satisfaction, of the disappointment and discontent that accompanies a success achieved too easily."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is uneven, too. Sometimes it flattens out. But most of the time it perks along entertainingly and doesn't let its ethical imperatives enshroud it in a pall of worthiness."
    },
    {
      "text": "A funny valentine with lots of laughs and warmth and some cute existential mindgames, Groundhog Day is a perfect vehicle for Bill Murray and a kick of a movie from start to finish."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day has a clever concept at its core, with a few extremely funny extrapolations. But because the jokes have to be set up by repetitions, the pattern becomes too predictable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day generates enough warmth, wit, humor, sexual chemistry, and spiritual resonance to light up a whole season of Valentine's Days."
    },
    {
      "text": "Beneath its veneer of of caustic laughs and touching romance is a subtle but profound spiritual odyssey."
    },
    {
      "text": "Murray transmutates from annoying human being to nice guy through the course of the film, but he and his script manage to keep most of his acerbic humor intact, which is the key to keeping Murray, and the film, interesting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sweetly slight and slightly sweet."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is a three-quarters-baked idea, combining It's A Wonderful Life and a Monty Python sketch. It's a very near miss, coming as close to its comic target as its release date comes to the holiday itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "Name me a recent Hollywood comedy with an original idea to its name. I thought so. Relief comes with Groundhog Day, the most delightfully refreshing and funny movie to hail from the studios in many a month."
    },
    {
      "text": "He hasn't been this funny and endearing in half a decade. He's at his smarmy-sarcastic best here, and Groundhog Day may be the movie that salvages Mr. Murray's career."
    },
    {
      "text": "Think hard for a moment What always happens when bills go astray? Exactly. Someone else pays for your mistakes or you for theirs; or else justice is done after long litigation. Groundhog Day is a mixture, but a delicious one, of all three."
    },
    {
      "text": "Given the obvious debt to the comedies of Capra the movie could have defrosted swiftly into a puddle of sentiment Mostly it stays crisp and sharp and bracing -- thanks to the cunning tangential way the central conceit is played out."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not entirely witless -- just about any movie starring Murray has its good low-humor -- Groundhog Day is nevertheless a movie about redundancy that is seriously redundant itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day offers OK Murray: not great, not awful, few huge laughs, no big lulls. It's another case of Murray outshining his material and, in the process, making the whole enterprise look better than it is."
    },
    {
      "text": "To look back on Murray's career is to see the development of a distinct strain of American humor, which has often been misunderstood or mangled on film. In Groundhog Day, Murray and Ramis return to the source, and they get it right."
    },
    {
      "text": "Dial your expectations to moderate, burrow in for the duration, and you won't be disappointed -- it ain't exactly springtime, but there are worse things than an amiable outing on a winter's night."
    },
    {
      "text": "It’s a promising idea, but scriptwriters Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis (Ramis also directed) seem to have no idea what a “better” Bill Murray would look like... in short, [he becomes] more cynical and manipulative than ever."
    },
    {
      "text": "Looking at what it became, it is a deception. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Anything with Bill Murray in it is worth seeing, and he's a hoot in the film's first half... But Groundhog Day fails apart somewhere in the middle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ironically, given the theme of the film, this never gets old. Winning performances, and respect for the comedic value of the script delivers laughs every time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its flaw is that it leads to an arbitrary story, the humor of which is born entirely from dramatically misarticulated repetitions. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "No film has understood [Bill Murray] better than Harold Ramis' brilliant Groundhog Day, a hilarious and unexpectedly profound comedy that breaks him down and reveals every conceivable facet of his personality."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is that rarest of cinematic pleasures -- a major studio Hollywood comedy that both delights and surprises."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is more than simply a great comedy - it's a modern metaphor for the path to enlightenment."
    },
    {
      "text": "I find it a masterpiece of comedic timing that ultimately starts with the deceptively brilliant script from Danny Rubin."
    },
    {
      "text": "On top of the time travel elements, Groundhog Day is also a hilarious comedy and beautiful romance. While we get to know Phil throughout the film, you also get to know Rita and what a complex person she is..."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of those rare cinematic occasions when extreme repetition only gets funnier."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie would be nothing without Murray's superb performance... Keep an eye on how his character develops in depth and self-awareness as he desperately looks for a way out of the rut."
    },
    {
      "text": "A great comedy with a solid message that doesn't hinder the delivery of the comedy."

    {
      "text": "Re-watching Groundhog Day yet again was pretty enlightening, actually!"
    },
    {
      "text": "Cult leader Keith Ranieri was my grade school classmate. What do we call his current prison situation? We call it \"Groundhog day.\" Perhaps millennials aren't familiar with the facts about when and how this term became part of America's cultural lexicon..."

      "text": "It would be impossible to understand the movie without that casual and inevitable tone delivered by Ramis and Murray. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Murray's performance doesn't only elevate the film to a completely different level but also elevates the work being put in by the rest of the cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "With his shifts from smugness to weirdness to some kind of local heroism, Murray controls the picture throughout. But Ramis works ably with his oddly assorted supporting cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "Are we all just wasting time squandering eternity? The film doesn't make this accusation lightly. And it takes an outrageous concept, a big premise with a science-fiction spin, to level the idea in terms we accept and understand."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ramis and Murray achieve a harmony of wit and wisdom that works so effortlessly on you, on us all, the phrase \"Groundhog Day\" in American vernacular has become a synonym for dj vu."
    },
    {
      "text": "Murray, more often than not, is pretty unbearable; but here, playing a man who is unbearable, Murray begins convincingly, amusingly, and gets even more amusing as he metamorphoses."
    },
    {
      "text": "Harold Ramis's direction is nothing special, yet there is a beautiful, lip-smacking efficiency in the way that a great idea is touched off and followed to its conclusion."
    },
    {
      "text": "When it comes to existential drama comedies about self realizations in a fantastic setting, [it] is right up there with films like \"Her\" and \"Eternal Sunshine.\""

      "text": "...the film's forgettable, padded-out nature confirms its place as a promising yet disposable high-concept comedy."

      "text": "The day is not a redo; it's a \"one more.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "While Murray's deadpan putdowns and dry dismissals of provincial peccadilloes are the comic highlights, Groundhog Day is no supercilious rip of small-town U.S.A."

    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is surprisingly inventive."
    },
    {
      "text": "MacDowell was never more convincing and Chris Elliott is a dry delight as her lens-man. Murray and movie, meanwhile, are a mutual godsend: Groundhog Day rescued his career from calcifying in self-caricature."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day may not be the funniest collaboration between Bill Murray and director Harold Ramis... Yet this gentle, small-scale effort is easily the most endearing film of both men's careers, a sweet and amusing surprise package."

      "text": "Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell have a ball with the main roles."

      "text": "Murray hasn't made a comedy this winningly dumb and smart and -- yes -- sweet in a long time. If, indeed, he ever has."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is a good vehicle for Murray, tailored to his deadpan style, and should please fans disappointed by some the comedian's recent movies."
    },
    {
      "text": "A movie that continually replays a single day could quickly become tedious but, strangely enough, Groundhog Day never does."
    },
    {
      "text": "Murray's wiseacre persona is perfect for what could be saccharine material in other hands."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie is expertly calculated to derive maximum comic energy from Bill Murray's great, deadpan mug and his drop-dead I'm-not-impressed line readings."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even if you applaud Bill Murray's evolution from inspired comedian to minimalist seriocomic actor, it's a relief to revisit his most varied and charming role as Phil Connors."

    {
      "text": "[A] great American comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Murray] carries Groundhog Day with his uniquely frittery nonchalance and makes the movie a comic time warp anyone should be happy to get stuck in."
    },
    {
      "text": "Groundhog Day is an immensely enjoyable fable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ramis' direction is often too cool and restrained. He wisely avoids playing into the tale's underlying sentimentality."

    {
      "text": "As well as a perfect star vehicle, the film is a brilliant analysis of the implications of the film's simple conceit."

      "text": "The film endures largely because of the appeal of both its story line and the cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie deserves its fans, earns our respect, delivers richly on its initial promises if not always on its greater ones, and rewards multiple viewings, even as it carries a built-in joke about the typical shelf-life of repeated experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "Since arriving as a mild success in 1993, Groundhog Day has gradually achieved the status of beloved. The American Film Institute rates it No.34 on its list of all-time funniest movies, and it's a story that bears frequent repeat viewings."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ramis directs this surreal suburban fantasy with an admirably light touch, revelling in its absurd repetitions, surprising us with narrative ellipses, and allowing Murray ample space to indulge his special mix of sarcasm and smarm."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a beautiful film. On the surface, a rolling ball, a silly comedy, a farce even. But a closer look, a closer look, reveals a beauty easily not seen."
