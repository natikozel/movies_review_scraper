    },
    {
      "text": "Don't Breathe is a viciously efficient thriller that's also, unfortunately, relatable. It's a battle of wills between two morally compromised characters."

    },
    {
      "text": "Lang's work here is physically impressive and justifiably evil-so much more striking than his performance as the scarfaced villain in Avatar."
    },
    {
      "text": "It truly is a shame that as the year winds down and the Academy begins handing out their Oscar nominations, Stephen Lang's performance won't even be looked at because the film is essentially a horror film with little dramatic substance"

      "text": "It's fantastic. Go watch it."

    {
      "text": "You can easily compare Don't Breathe to thriller horror classics like Psycho, Old Boy and Vertigo."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a film about agency - embracing it or denying someone of their own - and both the consequences of the choices we actively make as well as the evolving rationalizations we create to live with ourselves."
    },
    {
      "text": "A movie that made me hold my breath more than once, and managed to take suspense to heights most modern horror movies don't even bother with anymore."

    },
    {
      "text": "Even the recurring passages of pin-drop silence generate edge-of-the-seat dread."
    },
    {
      "text": "A suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse develops where a creaky floorboard is the difference between life and death. Lang makes an intimidating antagonist, but a silly final act ends things on a sour note."
    },
    {
      "text": "Terrific, taut, dry-throated thriller..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a decent piece of schlock suspense with enough thrills to shake the popcorn out of the box."
    },
    {
      "text": "Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, Don't Breathe keeps the terror going until the very end, but it takes a lot of liberties with credibility, even for the genre."
    },

      "text": "The best and most violent in the HOME ALONE series."

      "text": "...relies on some outlandish plot twists to amp up the ickiness."
    },
    {
      "text": "Don't Breathe mines much of its tension from its claustrophobic setting, with doors closed and dogs released on the intruders. (It also recalls indie horror It Follows in its desolate Detroit location.)"
    },
    {
      "text": "Works wonders with claustrophobia, tension, startling action, and in taking the home invasion film and giving it a unique twist."
    },
    {
      "text": "Don't Breathe shows once again that Alvarez is a competent filmmaker when it comes to directing, but thanks to a script riddled with plotholes and idiotic characters, it's clear that he and Sayagues still have a lot of work to do when it comes to writing."
    },
    {
      "text": "It will have you gasping with terror."
    },
    {
      "text": "Alvarez has a real talent for building tension and, in the young Levy, may have found the perfect acting foil for his particular brand of atmospheric horror."
    },
    {
      "text": "I wouldn't rank it in my top list of horror movies (I do prefer the more fantastical kind), if you lean more towards the human element of terror, this film will make you very aware of your breathing and racing heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "I never feel totally comfortable watching a movie in which the heroine is punched repeatedly in the face, in wide shot, by a muscle-bound psychopath until she blacks out."

      "text": "There's no excuse for the film's vile misogyny, even if violence against women is a staple ingredient of such films."
    },

      "text": "A thriller that manipulates the viewer loyalty with the characters, reversing the traditional roles in films that revolve around home invasions: you can't be sure that the invaders are guilty or that the overrun is a victim. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "A neat film, crudely accurate and intelligent. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The suspense is built as carefully as it is in a good John Carpenter movie; Alvarez uses the camera like a stealth weapon, exploring dark corners and hidden areas of the house with devilish glee."

    },
    {
      "text": "Suffocatingly tense for most of its taut 88-minute running time, home-invasion thriller Don't Breathe should, in the interest of the viewer's health, be re-titled: Don't Forget to Breathe."
    },

      "text": "Alvarez, take a bow. You sick freak."
    },
