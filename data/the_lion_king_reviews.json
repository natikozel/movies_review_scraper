    },
    {
      "text": "It swings back and forth tonally very awkwardly, but there are some thrilling moments and it is Barry Jenkins' usual cinematographer, James Laxton, so it is quite lovely at times. But I wish Jenkins would take his artistry where it is his."

      "text": "Jenkins’ treatment of this story, though he cannot rescue it from middling songs and segments that read as obvious IP management, is alternately sweeping and meditative."

    {
      "text": "The story is filled with romance and adventures on high cliffs, mountains, in caves, and in a far, fair land. It is in a form called photo realistic animation. It doesn't exactly look real, but it is close, thanks to state of the art digital animation."
    },
    {
      "text": "The greatest winner here is Mufasa, a character long-lamented yet underutilized in its previous iterations. Given the time and space to develop his character, this entry is successful in all aspects."
    },
    {
      "text": "...the biggest letdown of the film is that it just brushes through the characters without exploring the emotional dynamics and depth. Barry Jenkins’ Mufasa is enjoyable but nowhere close to The Lion King."
    },
    {
      "text": "If John Favreau had the Herculean task of bringing to tangible life the 1994 animated classic in The Lion King (2019), Barry Jenkins also does a fine job of giving Mufasa his own past, fears, journey, and value system."
    },

      "text": "The director keeps a firm if predictable hand on the tiller – the action scenes, such as lions trapped in that flooded river and an elephant stampede – are impressive but the script is limp."

    },
    {
      "text": "Improves on some of the styles that were the focus of criticisms from the previous \"live-action\" adaptation, but ultimately still fails. The songs fall flat, the story is basic, and the movie falls for all of the prequel tropes we've grown tired of."

    {
      "text": "A souless, visual monstrosity that reduces Scar to a guy upset he didn't get the girl. What a waste of a perfect villain."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Mufasa: The Lion King would have been perfect if its characters had fewer lines, and if the songs were in the background rather than emerging through the mouths of clearly computer-generated figures."
    },
    {
      "text": "‘Mufasa: The Lion King’ is an unnecessary prequel, but the music and ambitious production should please devoted fans."
    },

      "text": "The film’s photorealistic CGI is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing emotive expressions and intricate details that deliver awe-inspiring, heartwarming, and nail-biting moments."
    },

      "text": "What proves much more interesting, and reminiscent of director Barry Jenkins’ earlier work, is the exploration of masculinity through the relationship between Mufasa and Taka."
    },
    {
      "text": "Had this been released in 2D animation back in the 1990s as a sequel to the original it would have been perfectly servicable entertainment for toddlers and pre-teens, but Disney’s creativity is clearly wearing thin with this one."
    },
    {
      "text": "Maybe this reads like we’re making excuses, but it feels like the main issues with the film fall beyond Jenkins’ purview as a director..."
    },
    {
      "text": "…given that the 2019 Lion King was a huge success, this prequel/sequel should ensnare part of the same audience, but it’s a big step down from the original remake...families are more likely to dig Sonic 3 than this rather inessential, pompous rehash…."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ultimately, a more or less adequate Disney prequel is a waste of the gifts of a director who has poetry in his heart and other, more important stories to tell."

      "text": "This is not a terrible movie by any means, just a bland addition to a very good story."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Mufasa: The Lion King a hit with younger viewers, but anyone looking for something more will see another lifeless chapter in Disney’s quest to mine its own history."
    },
    {
      "text": "Mufasa: The Lion King is a visual improvement over the unimaginative 2019 live action remake but ultimately treads similar waters.\n\nWhile it’s by-the-numbers narratively, and the songs are a far cry from the original, there are some entertaining moments."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may not reach the heights of Disney classics of yesteryear, but 'Mufasa: The Lion King' is a movie worth watching for the clear attempt to turn it into something it could never have been."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is technically impressive, as there is no denying how well-animated each animal is... Barry Jenkins attempts to deliver captivating character moments, but you feel at arms length throughout most of its run-time, and the pacing is all over the place."

      "text": "I’m glad Barry Jenkins got his bag, though."

    },
    {
      "text": "The animated musical Mufasa: The Lion King delivers the expected eye-catching visuals, but the story, dialogue, and songs are underwhelming and tedious. This disappointing prequel lazily copies the formula of other Lion King films."
    },
    {
      "text": "A marked improvement from the \"dead eye\" version of 2019, this critic-proof film amps up the adventure and atmosphere. Timon and Pumbaa need their own film. while Disney took no risks in storytelling and themes, The Lion King is the Monarch of Animation."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jenkins isn’t afraid to allow his animals to take on a few human qualities. He sacrifices perfection to achieve emotional expression. The filmmaker tackles this prequel as if it were an animated film and, even better, Disney allows him that freedom."

      "text": "The story in Mufasa: The Lion King is a big improvement over The Lion King (2019)."

      "text": "Not bad, but it doesn’t add anything to what’s already known and loved."
    },
    {
      "text": "The rubbery expressiveness of traditional animation is replaced by the feeling of a nature documentary where the narrator’s attempt to graft human emotions onto wild animals never quite feels like it takes."

      "text": "Mufasa is not a bad choice for a holiday-season matinee with the grandkids, but it’s far from the pride of the Disney jungle."

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "The more we got into the story, the more it felt like it was forced to connect the dots to what we know of the original The Lion King. Taka's reason for turning villain was a complete letdown. The songs were, unfortunately, forgetful."
