    },
    {
      "text": "I don’t care how much the other movies have made, having a Transformers movie free of the chaos and beer-commercial filmmaking of Michael Bay is a breath of fresh air. Sure, it’s still noisy, cluttered and bombastic, but at least this movie is coherent."
    },
    {
      "text": "So much to champion here, starting with director Josh Cooley's vision, to the groundbreaking animation, set designs add a new level of cinematic artistry to the franchise as the new look is stunning, not to mention realistic--the BEST film of them all!"

      "text": "Combining a lively pace, striking visuals, scattered big laughs, and resilient and resourceful heroes, it's targeted primarily at kids but offers a nostalgic kick for an older generation, too."

    },
    {
      "text": "It had to play to its emotional strengths and get us invested in the friendship that is the spark at the heart of this film, so that when the friends turn to enemies, it hits you hard. And in this one job, Transformers One succeeds."

    {
      "text": "I can’t think of a better way to describe this movie other than that this is more than meets the eye."

      "text": "While just cutesy enough for the little ones and smart enough to pull in parents, this outing is more than meets the eye."
    },
    {
      "text": "The rusted franchise gets reanimated, sparking some of the best buddy comedy banter, satisfying character arcs, and enough cheer-worthy moments to roll out immediately to see theatrically."
    },
    {
      "text": "By making the shift from live-action to animation, the film is better able to channel a sense of imagination that was often lost amidst the ponderous narratives and chaotic action beats of the earlier films."
    },
    {
      "text": "Knock me over with an iron feather, but this Transformers is a rousing adventure story with origin implications, jokes that actually work & a lively all-star cast. Going back to animation (for the 1st time since 1986!) was the best strategy for revival."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Ultimately the film struggles to balance its various commitments, with a screenplay that never seems sure of whether it wants to be a pure comedy, a lore-packed adventure or a peppy children’s film that shuffles kids straight to the toy aisle."
    },
    {
      "text": "I had a thought that seemed at once plausible and absurd. Taking in its landscape of moody pastel skies and jagged spears of metal and rock overgrown by vines and purple-pink moss, I wondered: Is this Transformers movie inspired by Andrei Tarkovsky?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Cooley’s film makes a good spinoff suddenly seem simple: Sometimes all you need is the imagination for heroes and villains, betrayal and glory — and heaps of plastic to smash together."
    },
    {
      "text": "Runs like a well-oiled piece of “Transformers” machinery, but lacks the spark that would raise it beyond fan-friendly formula."

      "text": "No matter how much various filmmakers attempt to strip it back down from Bay-level bombast, Transformers can’t escape itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "Transformers One is a standalone movie, one that offers up copious Easter Eggs for longtime fans, and a top-notch, entertaining entryway, with great characters and slick animation, for new fans."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a shiny, chaotic distraction that generates new marketing opportunities without any new artistic vision."
    },
    {
      "text": "The animation in “Transformers One” is spectacular and lavishly detailed, and plummets us into a whole new, intriguing world."
    },
    {
      "text": "“Transformers” will always be most beloved to Generation X as a cartoon series in the ‘80s, so it’s fitting that the franchise has literally gone back to the drawing board for one of its best efforts."

    },
    {
      "text": "The movie we fans have been waiting our entire lives; a perfect combination of heart, action, & humor. An animated adventure of cinematic wonderment, enriching the mythology, respecting the past while looking at the future. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite being a brand agnostic and not giving a darn about how Optimus and Megatron went from best buds to mortal enemies, I rather enjoyed Transformers One. It's a visually rousing, PLF-worthy sci-fi melodrama aimed at smart kids rather than dumb adults."

      "text": "The writing team here isn’t above reciting the brand’s slogan to punctuate tropes. They fare better with the slapstick comedy -- how this movie makes pratfalls funny again is actually quite miraculous."
    },
    {
      "text": "Transformers One isn't good enough to watch on a plane, even a trans-Pacific flight. The inflight map is better."

      "text": "While Transformers One does feel like a very well-animated Saturday morning cartoon, the plot is well thought out and the writing is smart and funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "A great watch for longtime fans and their kids. Though the franchise’s box office success in this century has been predicated on noisy live action with a CGI assist, this exciting and fun-filled film returns the Transformers to their animated roots."

    },
    {
      "text": "“Transformers One” is a classic class warfare, friendships, trust, loyalty and betrayal. More importantly, it's about the conscious choice each one makes. Fully animated, it's thrilling with high energy and heart, and may be the most human story of all."
    },
    {
      "text": "A realm without physical limits is truly where the Transformers belong, but it doesn’t stop the film from delivering some surprising pathos while it’s there."

      "text": "A dull, tedious and ultimately exhausting animated action adventure with dazzling CGI. In a double feature with The Wild Robot, it would be the shallow and inferior B-movie."
    },

      "text": "It’s an origin story that’s fixated on doing something original with those origins, which pays off and shows that there is more than meets the eye to this franchise"
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie touches on several themes, like exploitation, corruption, and worker empowerment, in an engaging, entertaining, and fun way for the whole family. Viewers would be wrong to dismiss Transformers One as a “mindless’ cash-grab kids movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Transformers One excels, especially in the context of the previous Transformers film canon, in its exploration and definition of its characters, humanizing them and underscoring the tragedy that led former brothers-in-arms to become deadly enemies."

    },
    {
      "text": "The story adds some nice twists to the Transformers’ mythos, and it will doubtlessly appeal to both longtime fans and their children. But while the film contains action and humor, it fails to seamlessly integrate its themes into the narrative."
