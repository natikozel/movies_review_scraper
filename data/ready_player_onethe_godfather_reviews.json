    },
    {
      "text": "Although there are some fun sequences and genuine wonder to behold, the film is a pandering, noisy, visual mess with a thin plot and even thinner characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's Spielberg's sloppiest film since Hook, but still has enough moments that transcend simple nostalgia to make it worthwhile even if it is an uneven thrill ride."

    },
    {
      "text": "READY PLAYER ONE is the prime example of just how hollow big budget filmmaking has become and ranks as one of the worst movies Spielberg has ever made, even though it represents an amalgamation of what has made his movies so iconic."
