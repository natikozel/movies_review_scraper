      "text": "Buried upon its release by another extra-terrestrial story, the GOAT remake perfectly blends science fiction and horror into a still-arresting symphony of terror.\nChristopher Lloyd"
    },
    {
      "text": "In my eyes, The Thing is as perfect as a movie can get: it knows exactly what it wants to be and what it’s trying to do, and succeeds on every level I can conceive."
    },
    {
      "text": "Incredible atmosphere and simple effective thrills"
    },
    {
      "text": "Carpenter stresses the slimy ET at the expense of characterisation, mood and practically everything else, yet it's precisely this one grisly facet that makes it such compelling science fiction."
    },
    {
      "text": "The solemnity of the frozen wastes contrasts brilliantly with the sweaty paranoia of the men, who are unsure which of their colleagues is next going to erupt with hidden jaws and shooting tendrils."
    },
    {
      "text": "... an alien invasion horror masterpiece, a kind of survivalist chamber drama set in a remote research station in the icy Arctic where a small group men without women are confronted by an insidious takeover."
    },
    {
      "text": "While the close-quarters direction is stellar, full of tight, terrifying spaces, and the cast is excellent (led by Kurt Russell), the real strength of the film lies in the special effects by Rob Bottin."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tremendously fun. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a nihilistic look at survival at all costs, in which the men become as dangerous as the thing they’re hunting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Since no one knows who has been infected until it is too late, The Thing becomes a nightmare guessing-game which Carpenter exploits most efficiently."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing is full of terrifying sequences, but one stands out as one of the most innovative and scary set pieces of John Carpenter's entire career."
    },
    {
      "text": "Every October, I revisit John Carpenter’s “The Thing” to celebrate the month of Halloween, and every year I arrive at the same conclusion: it's one of the most effective horror films ever made."
    },
    {
      "text": "THE THING (1982) was not exactly John Carpenter's breakthrough film, but it may well be his best film."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing fully realizes its potential as a thriller of nightmare proportions."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film sets the stage for a piercingly chilly descent into the unraveling human condition."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing's brilliance rests on the equilibrium between implied and visceral horror, often incompatible ideas that Carpenter stirs together in a stylish, engrossing way."
    },
    {
      "text": "This version is so full of \"the thing\" that it strangles our imagination and becomes a mere exercise in ugly, mechanical horrorifics. Very dumb, very disappointing."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing is like The Howling, a showcase for fiber and latex and the products they produce, by and for people who need their nightmares to be completely comprehensible and completely unreal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Such a pity. John Carpenter is too gifted a moviemaker to let nauseating special effects take over his biggest film, but that's what happened in The Thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "...a methodically-paced endeavor that essentially (and effectively) captures the viewer's interest and attention right from the get-go..."
    },
    {
      "text": "A masterpiece of horror filmmaking."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whether it scares you with its paranoia, claustrophobic setting, Ennio Morricone's brooding score or Rob Bottin's bar-raising practical creature effects, The Thing's sole purpose is to get under your skin..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's what all horror connoisseurs crave; a mysterious and evocative beginning, a steady burgeoning of tension, and enough left unexplained leveled with the right amount of terror shown. It is a masterpiece of filmmaking."
    },
    {
      "text": "My favorite horror movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Few filmmakers understand how to use practical effects as well as the master of cult horror, John Carpenter."
    },
    {
      "text": "Far surpassing most of the CG work of the time, the practical creature and makeup effects continue to amaze even today."
    },

      "text": "An amazing adventure that... contains scenes that speak for themselves of the enormous talent of the same person responsible for Halloween. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The sheer nastiness of it all had an imprinting effect on a generation of budding cinema buffs. It's one of the first films I can recall seeing that felt like it was trying to hurt you."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the midst of all the special effects, it is ultimately about the psychological impact of a high stress situation."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing feels like a perfect movie. An embarrassment of riches all concentrated in a single feature film that stands the test of time in a way that few stories do."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its groundbreaking visual effects, terrific ensemble, and haunted-house atmosphere, is now rightfully regarded as an all-time horror classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing is set in an all-male environment, and is as much a study of masculinity in crisis as an update of the sort of siege scenario that Carpenter had already played out in Assault on Precinct 13."
    },
    {
      "text": "What really is there left to say about John Carpenter's The Thing? A true genre classic from 1982, the film is an all-time favourite of many and often cited as a sci-fi horror masterclass."
    },
    {
      "text": "fascinating, horrifying, and utterly engaging from the first frame to the last"
    },
    {
      "text": "Graphically violent, gory, grisly, and frightening, though it's so over-the-top and dated that the gore is almost campy."
    },
    {
      "text": "With a thick, thick air of intense paranoia and jaw-dropping monster effects work, The Thing stands as one of the greatest films of both the horror and science fiction genres."
    },
    {
      "text": "Far and away the best film of John Carpenter's career."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like Ridley Scott's 1979 classic \"Alien\" before it, \"The Thing\" is science-fiction/horror with a visionary punch that continues to resonate and inspire filmmakers decades later."
    },
    {
      "text": "John Carpenter's The Thing boasts outstanding special effects, skilled direction and cinematography, and a tension-filled story, making for one of the legendary director's most cherished works."
    },
    {
      "text": "It personifies the definition of \"popcorn entertainment\" - that is, the kind of film that relishes the thrill of its many ambitious moments without seeking total transcendence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Something close to an absolutely perfect exercise in how to construct a thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "A magnificent cabinet of grotesqueries, one of the decade's great works"
    },
    {
      "text": "I'll say it: the single greatest horror movie ever made."
    },
    {
      "text": "...stays truer to its source material, John W. Campbell, Jr.'s 1938 novella Who Goes There?, than the 1951 Howard Hawks-Christian Nyby feature The Thing from Another World."
    },
    {
      "text": "...reading this as a Cold War allegory is doing the movie a very big favor. In reality, this is a film about tentacles and teeth and eyes and orifices and goo, goo, goo."
    },
    {
      "text": "I discovered what it was to love a movie that was relentless in its desire to be unpleasant"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing is a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror."
    },
    {
      "text": "Carpenter's direction is slow, dark, and stately; he seems to be aiming for an enveloping, novelistic kind of effect, but all he gets is heaviness."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a paranoid masterpiece, and that rare remake that improves upon the original."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not just an excellent remake, it's an excellent movie, and an almost perfect horror movie..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shows more originality, wit and invention than possibly any other film you might call a remake... as influential as Alien for its blend of action, sci-fi and chilling horror."
    },
    {
      "text": "The special effects can't hope to be as creepy to our seen-it-all eyes as they were to the film's first viewers, but we can still enjoy the monster's unique weirdness, and the story is a rock-solid yarn."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's pretty scary and entertaining stuff, though I always get the feeling that nothing in it lives up to the tremendous opening section."
    },
    {
      "text": "An accomplished horror movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing is a masterpiece: a black comedy, monster movie, conspiracy thriller and whodunit."
    },
    {
      "text": "Carpenter's rethinking of producer Howard Hawks' classic is an honorable attempt to hew closer to the original story."
    },
    {
      "text": "Contains everything you could want to know about horror filmmaking."
    },
    {
      "text": "If it's the most vividly guesome monster ever to stalk the screen that audiences crave, then The Thing is the thing. On all other levels, however, John Carpenter's remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 sci-fi classic comes as a letdown."
    },
    {
      "text": "Great entertainment. Just try not to take it too seriously."
    },
    {
      "text": "Russell's sub-Eastwood heroics hardly compensate for the absence of all characterisation, while Bill Lancaster's script boasts the most illogical climax any monster movie ever had."
    },
    {
      "text": "John Carpenter equaled the unrelenting suspense of Halloween with this nerve-racking remake. Carpenter's The Thing is one of the all-time great horror films."
    },
    {
      "text": "The original has been built up to classic scale, but Carpenter's remake is actually far scarier and equally thoughtful."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Thing may be a tad too careful and schematic to stand shoulder with Carpenter's very best films."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because this material has been done before, and better, especially in the original The Thing and Alien, there's no need to see this version."
    },
    {
      "text": "I never got into this. Very slow, dated special effects, and obvious exploration of the paranoia theme."
    },
    {
      "text": "Mr. Carpenter has demonstrated that he can make good, comparatively plain, old-fashioned scare movies and effective suspense thrillers, but he seems to lose his own head when he combines two or more genres, as he [does here]."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wild, gruesome and outrageous"
    },
    {
      "text": "The claustrophobic group becomes the perfect petri dish in which to create an environment of fear, paranoia, and betrayal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Films like this make me hope against hope that, some day...one day...the real John Carpenter will return."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bit too heavy on the shock effects, but far scarier than most average horror films."
    },
    {
      "text": "Underlining every frame of The Thing is an anticipating dread: the characters -- and the viewer -- sense the potential menace of an enemy they cannot see."
    },
    {
      "text": "Pointless remake of the 1951 by the usually overrated John Carpenter"
    },
    {
      "text": "This is one of those great films which inspire inarticulate awe within your humble narrator rather than verbose declarations of praise."
    },
    {
      "text": "Genuinely scary and full of tension, and populated by one bad-ass monster."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Carpenter makes effective use of his source material - there is a real sense of paranoia and real tension hanging over onscreen proceedings . . ."
    },
    {
      "text": "Horror movies don't get much better than this."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is one of those rare remakes that remains faithful to the premise of the original but does something unique with the concept."
