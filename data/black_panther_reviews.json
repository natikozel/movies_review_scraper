      "text": "Coogler keeps Black Panther: Wakanda Forever absorbing and coherent, with a thoroughly thought-out set of antagonists and a chest-swelling tribute to Chadwick Boseman, giving the characters and the audience the space to grieve him."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rather than position Namor as a man who suffered an unfortunate, but centuries-old, part of nation-building, Wakanda Forever reminds us that imperial powers remain at work today."
    },
    {
      "text": "From his [Ryan Coogler] dynamic vision of recreating Namor’s origin to his exploration of themes of Indigenous Latin cultures, Wakanda Forever is an innovative and refreshing take on superhero lore."
    },
    {
      "text": "The entire film aches with a melancholy at the passing of Boseman but it feels like a film that wants to embrace him and move on in his memory rather than wallow in the sadness of the loss."

    {
      "text": "The pacing, demons, and storytelling monsters take down the film."

      "text": "“Wakanda Forever” is an epic, emotional and profound film that examines the impact of collective anguish."
    },
    {
      "text": "Apart from the overarching themes of death, loss, revenge and owning your destiny, and all the eye-popping battles atop barnacle-crusted whales and dolphins no less, Black Panther 2 works in the smaller, intimate moments too."

    {
      "text": "This was a fantastic way to wrap out Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coogler uses the sequel to similarly popularize Mayan Futurism with the sumptuous introduction of the Talokans, which makes the Wakandans seem quotidian in comparison."

    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever may not quite measure up to its predecessor, but it leaves a proud, beautiful, silent tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman, telling an emotionally powerful, resonant story about how grief can truly be love persevering."

    {
      "text": "Plays with ideas and characters that initially intrigue, but drowns them in tiresome excessive Marvel lore and universe expansion."

      "text": "This sequel acts as an uplifting reminder that grief is real and losing someone close doesn't mean losing all hope in the power of community."
    },
    {
      "text": "Beautiful tribute about Grief & the cycle of violence. Epic in almost all standards but slower in pacing to tell a different kind of story in the MCU."
    },
    {
      "text": "As evocative as it is in the film, light pierces through every shot, every storyline, and every performance, making it a remarkable love letter to grief and healing."

    {
      "text": "Wakanda Forever is the best Black Panther sequel it could have been, acting both as a tribute to Boseman and a poignant story about change and rebirth."
    },
    {
      "text": "We deserve a story about Africanness and Diasporic Blackness that’s not hampered by the white gaze that would refuse us peace, justice, unity and vengeance. In the MCU, no matter who’s at the helm, that’s just not possible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther Wakanda Forever is undoubtedly one of the worst movies of the year and a clear indication for Marvel to start making movies again instead of peddling products that promote future products."

    },

      "text": "Wakanda Forever is very long and needed an intermission. You know it’s a Marvel movie because it’s steeped in boredom, with every scene threatening to not end."
    },
    {
      "text": "lack Panther: Wakanda Forever has the usual MCU mix of humour and fun action scenes but it's severely lacking a charismatic lead performer, and some of the lazy writing during the final third was frankly embarrassing. One of the weaker MCU efforts."

    {
      "text": "Its pacing may feel a bit undercalculated as some scenes consume too much screen time, though unsure footing can be forgiven by closed chapters and new beginnings."
    },
    {
      "text": "The sheer volume of subplots makes the finished product rather unwieldy, struggling to maintain the tight thematic focus of ‘Black Panther.’"

      "text": "There's already something kind of special about a movie that's largely about grief being made as an act of grieving."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wakanda Forever tries to be a tribute and a recapitulation and a cog in the ever-grinding Marvel machine. The result is sometimes moving and intermittently watchable. But it’s a also a mess—not least in its politics."

    },
    {
      "text": "The tribute here is heartfelt, but the spirit of the man and the character sometimes get lost in all the bric-a-brac of the Marvel machine... the film lands on a triumphant note of succession, as it must– the gods inside and above the narrative demand it."

    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a good film, that much is certain. At the same time it fails to quite match the extraordinary impact of the original Black Panther."

    {
      "text": "You can hear a pin drop in the first five minutes of Wakanda Forever. It’s intense and doesn’t let go of wrestling with loss, the cycle of violence and how we respond to it all throughout its running time. Even with that, this film is a vibe!"
    },
    {
      "text": "In this meta way, there is this audience recognition that the actors on screen aren’t just going through the motions here and what you’re witnessing isn’t a performance of grief, but an actual show of grief."
    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever entertains but also disappoints, perhaps because we expect so much more."
    },
    {
      "text": "Angela Bassett is in control with a cinematic elegance that can't be taught or directed - it's in her DNA making this sequel another reason for audiences to cross arms proclaiming Wakanda Forever with pride and tribute to Chadwick Boseman."

    },
    {
      "text": "Where The Avengers: Endgame lacked in its depiction of post-traumatic psychological exploration, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever makes up for in its examination of grief as a motivator and the difficulty of moving on from a core part of one’s own identity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though it will be remembered for the strong performances by Wright and Bassett, and the way it powerfully honors Boseman, the storytelling is standard and lacking the same strength."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a tribute to Chadwick Boseman, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a beautiful remembrance of the man, the talent, and the character under his brief stewardship. As a movie, though, the results become a bit shakier."
    },
    {
      "text": "For the most part, Coogler balances the film’s onscreen and offscreen needs extremely well. But three areas didn’t quite work for me."
    },

      "text": "From veteran Angela Bassett’s emotional speeches to the introduction of young genius Riri Williams (Dominique Heart), there’s plenty to be optimistic about in this crowded but emotionally satisfying Black Panther return."

    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever falls noticeably short of its predecessor in many respects except for an unnecessarily bloated 161-minute running time that could easily have trimmed with a few slashes of the title character’s vibranium-enriched claws."
    },
    {
      "text": "It risks letting women handle all the heroics, not a favorite idea among many fanboys—but an approach that succeeds."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may not be the most exciting superhero flick, but Wakanda Forever makes up for its shortcomings with touching drama and terrific acting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Ryan Coogler tries valiantly to make this all work and it does here and there. In the end his considerable gifts are arguably better suited to grounded human drama than superhero pictures."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much like the Star Wars galaxy or Tolkien's Middle Earth, Wakanda is becoming the realest kind of fictional place, one that inspires collaboration by artists and writers and ordinary fans."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a pretty compelling narrative with the perfect amount of fuel to really make us question how far off T'Challa's path grief has taken Shuri. Ultimately a narrative bridge for the MCU, it always strives to deliver upon its own drama first."
    },
    {
      "text": "“Black Panther,” in fact, is on a higher plan than most. It creates a world, inhabits it and gives reasons for its people’s actions. It’s a bold mission statement that’s largely due to Coogler. He makes the 160 minutes worthwhile."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like its predecessor, <i>Wakanda Forever</i> often feels more like it's occupying its own space than advancing the larger narrative."
    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever offers a lot of surprises, plenty of action, and a fitting tribute to Boseman as well as to Wakanda. Get your passport stamped and return to Wakanda because it is Well Worth Watching,"
    },
    {
      "text": "…Wakanda Forever may well have fans, but it’s hard to imagine anyone who could prefer this bloated, confusing film to the far more effective original…."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever makes for a melancholy conclusion to phase four."
    },
    {
      "text": "A moving and entertaining superhero action movie that forges a bright new path for the Black Panther legacy. It’s the follow-up that fans needed."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is indeed a  smattering of the character development. No doubt all abustle, some critics just understandably might’ve missed the transmogrifications. (Hint: Look for someone putting on a mask and another going all hue-y.)"
    },
    {
      "text": "It’s generally well-paced and features an excellent lead performance from Wright and an Oscar-worthy performance from Bassett. For a movie with a complicated hole to dig itself out of, this sequel rises victorious."
    },
    {
      "text": "Kind of a mixed bag, but worth seeing if you liked the first one."
    },
    {
      "text": "This film, leading into phase five, makes it as symbolic as it is impactful. It expands the MCU’s diversity through sheer authenticity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like the first Black Panther movie, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever asks us to consider why and when vengeance is futile, and what the difference is between an antihero and an anti villain."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not only is it a powerful tribute to a star whose screen presence could never be duplicated; it also points the way forward for Marvel, positing a future where the formula can be bent in directions that don't always dutifully fill a mold..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wakanda Forever is best as a love letter to a fallen friend, and as a kind of conduit for public grief."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the end, Wakanda Forever is about a choice. Do you rage? Or do you accept and let go. Saying farewell without forgetting.  Moving on.  That Coogler managed to embed that in a Marvel movie is a minor miracle and fitting tribute to the talent we lost."
    },
    {
      "text": "While suffering from exhausting connections to the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is an emotional tribute to Chadwick Boseman, with an exploration of grief easily capable of reaching the audience’s heart."
    },

      "text": "A palpable low point for the Marvel Cinematic Universe..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Finally breaking the tyranny of the superhero blockbuster structure, filmmaker Ryan Coogler makes an unusually affecting sequel that takes a darker and far more emotional approach to storytelling."
    },
    {
      "text": "You may not be ready for everything that Black Panther is going to throw at you. It is unapologetically Black, African, colorful, and poignant."
    },
    {
      "text": "...the positive side, the performances are strong and the visual effects are outstanding.  But great effects do not always a great movie make (I’m looking at you, “Avatar”) and the humanity that Boseman brought to the title character is greatly missed."
    },
    {
      "text": "his film could have been tone-deaf or insensitive. It could have simply not existed at all. The fact that it does exist and is a solid cinematic experience is, on its face, fairly miraculous."

      "text": "Overall, the film is solid with a few passages worth going to the theater for. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Angela Bassett and Letitia Wright are stand outs as audiences can feel the pain they are going through from losing their beloved star and friend."
    },
    {
      "text": "Feels overstuffed, filled with interesting ideas and possibilities that never fully come into focus."
    },
    {
      "text": "You can still see the bones of the original concept, poking jaggedly through the flesh of the story, and meshing not at all with the new material about grieving and coming to grips with loss."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a great film that does have it's flaws, specifically its length. This was a heavy film that has a lot of deep meaning and themes that might go over the general audience's head. The performances and costumes were fantastic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie is very solid despite being 20 minutes too long. Namor was a fantastic villain/anti-hero. The costume designs were incredible as were the performances, particularly Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett. The latter should absolutely be nominated!"
    },
    {
      "text": "This is the first Marvel that dealt with death and change in the most realistic way. \"Wakanda Forever\" takes this genre to another level because of the performances, world building and emotional gravity of the story."
    },
    {
      "text": "The plot is sometimes messy, with many moving parts, but the film gives its actors—especially Wakanda’s formidable women—powerful performances and moments to shine."
    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever never reaches the highs of its predecessor or some of Marvel’s best. It’s still an impressive achievement from Coogler and his cast, all of whom seemingly pour their personal experience of losing Boseman into their roles."
    },
    {
      "text": "While 'Wakanda Forever' is ultimately a very good superhero film, it's hard not to think of what it could have been."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nobody expects Shakespearean dialogue in these films, but the script and the plot should not be this crummy."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is a creatively made sequel as well as a fitting tribute to Chadwick Boseman"
    },
    {
      "text": "When the film lets all the crushing pressures of the MCU narrative take a backseat, it’s a wonderful film, worthy of Chadwick Boseman’s legacy and a strong representation of the diversity and beauty that can be possible in the superhero genre."
    },
    {
      "text": "The MCU’s mechanics are too oppressive to allow for true mournful meditation."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a fitting tribute to a beloved actor and the character he played."
    },
    {
      "text": "What results is an undoubtedly muted and depressing film, with almost all of the issues that plagued the production manifesting themselves on screen and having a deleterious impact."
    },
    {
      "text": "With a sleeker script (Wakanda Forever runs 161 minutes), Wright and Huerta Mejía might have owned the sequel the way Boseman and Jordan owned the original, but their performances get lost in a rush of bland battles and baffling detours."
    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a film that works well as a respectfully choreographed and undeniably dignified farewell to its leading man -- less so as a lesson in coherent, big-budget storytelling."
    },
    {
      "text": "Marvel has painted yet another three-dimensional \"villain,\" if you want to call him that, so I think Marvel and Ryan Coogler and the writers did a good job at conveying that once again."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ryan Coogler handles the vast story and scope of Black Panther: Wakanda Forever with impressive skill and pulls off a feat that a less skilled director would have left muddled."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a tribute to the Black Panther -- the late Chadwick Boseman -- Wakanda Forever is incredibly moving. It also has some astonishing women dominating the big screen in the best possible way."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first Black Panther... set a bar Wakanda Forever didn't come close to matching. But taken on its own terms, as a superhero sequel tasked with serving an unusually wide range of needs, it stands as a different kind of accomplishment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wow! You’ll say that over and over again as this mind-blowing, superhero epic unfolds. Wow!"
    },
    {
      "text": "Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is certainly a lot of movie and a fitting tribute to the legacy of Chadwick Boseman. While some mileage may vary with the pacing and plottiness, the movie does provide a thrilling entry in the saga of Wakanda."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wakanda Forever may not be the perfect Marvel movie, but [it] prove its worthiness as a bridge – not merely between Phase 4 and Phase 5... but from the bleakness of loss to a stable place from which a new generation can move forward."

    },
    {
      "text": "It’s certainly not the worst Marvel film (remember Eternals? Me neither), and there are moments of true excellence—particularly Angela Bassett’s performance of rage and grief. But it’s disappointing to see the promising setup fizzle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite these issues, and the overlong running time (two hours and 41 minutes) this is an entertaining superhero movie, with some effective dramatic elements."
    },
    {
      "text": "Returning director Coogler has defied the odds to marshal something that satisfies the demands of the Marvel production line, expands on the original’s themes of colonialism, and is sensitive tribute to his friend."

    },
    {

      "text": "The most unlikely Marvel film ever... they take these really small bites of grieving, and they can extend them and live in them, and still be able to tell an engaging action-oriented story."
    },
