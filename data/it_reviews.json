  "synopsis": "BOB TREVINO LIKES IT is inspired by the true friendship that writer/director Tracie Laymon found with a stranger when looking for her father online. Often playing the role of caretaker to people like her father who should be caring for her, Lily Trevino longs for a familial connection, having been abandoned by her mother as a child and then suddenly by her father in her twenties. Bob Trevino works long hours alone at a construction company to support his wife Jeanie's scrapbooking habit. The couple has endured a lot in the past decade, and Bob has sought to put his wife first, to the point of ignoring his own feelings and need for friendship, meaning, and connection--that is, until he gets an unexpected Facebook message from a stranger. Lily and Bob's blossoming friendship becomes a vital source of connection and healing in both their lives. Bob's small acts of fatherly kindness fill a familial void in Lily's life and hold the power to change her direction forever. In their own ways, these two must both learn they are worthy of extraordinary love exemplified through small acts of kindness.",
