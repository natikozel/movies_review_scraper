      "text": "Its great screenplay allows for a little more storyline and suspense then what we expect from most comedy films while Jason Bateman once again shows why he is the current king of comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Flush with snickering hilarity and scoring plenty of points for swerving surprises, Game Night is infectiously entertaining with any cheese it serves."
    },
    {
      "text": "Harkening back to the mid-budget comedy movies that have sadly disappeared from the mainstream, Game Night is the sort of breezy movie that has great potential for universal appeal, if only people are able to find out about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Plemons steals every scene he is in. I also can’t say enough about the comic timing of both Bateman and McAdams. Both work at just the right pitch and hold everything together even as things begin to unravel in the third act."
    },
    {
      "text": "Consistently funny and filled with dark screwball antics, Game Night is a rare, satisfying modern comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Game Night] looked like another run-of-the-mill R-rated comedy but it ended up providing a bunch of laughs and a surprising amount of filmmaking panache."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie knows what it is and doesn't try to do more than that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Isn't slap your knee funny but it is an amiable enough comedy that makes up in charm what it lacks in procedural thrills."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rather than scripting the film to lighten up on the seriousness, the characters must betray normalcy to better fit insincere resolutions."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night offers enough hearty laughs to take your mind off the rest of life's daily frustrations."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's certainly a pleasant surprise for a late February release."
    },
    {
      "text": "By repeating itself in tone and material, the script begins to feel unintentionally contrived . . . the laughs of the first half turn to giggles at most by the middle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is a perfectly executed by-the-book comedy thriller, by which I mean that its limited conception is carried out with the utmost technical proficiency."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is an uproarious dark comedy that, sticking true to its name, has fun playing around with your preconceptions."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much like a real game night, sometimes the success or failure of a film like this depends on the players, and in this case, everyone seems game."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, there are points in which the story twists feel arbitrary, but that is offset by the movie's briskness and good-natured sense of adventure."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an impressively dense script with minimal pacing problems."
    },
    {
      "text": "The long joke of the narrative is adroitly handled, and for once the climax pays off in laughs."
    },
    {
      "text": "The secret weapon of the film is Jesse Plemons as the unsettling Gary."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a team effort with everyone working together in harmony to get the job done to surprisingly great effect."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is never not enjoyable and the ensemble cast is fantastic. It's a fun movie that's completely entertaining."

      "text": "Wanna go out and get a surprise at the theater? Take your seat and laugh at these folks in one of the first great comedies of 2018."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is a hilarious, deranged take on growing up and finding our weekly spark, if not an absolutely insane riff off Clue meets Keanu (in some weird mainstream comedy universe)."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has its issues, the premise is perhaps milked for all its worth and we don't get much pay off with every storyline, but Game Night is still a step in the right direction for broad comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "With so much of the same films being produced and shoved down our throats these days, it's nice to get something a little out of the ordinary for a change."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film does have a lot of laughs, even if they sometimes feel unevenly distributed among its impressive comic ensemble."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night works best when it focuses on the personalities of its characters and meanders when it pays too much attention to the particulars of the plots-within-the-plot."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its cast is very inspired and the fearsome encounter with action thriller features works better than expected. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night's not much more than disposable popcorn fun, but at 100 minutes, not being a sequel or a (...) remake, and not overstaying its welcome? Not a bad way to blow a Friday night."
    },
    {
      "text": "If there is such an oxymoron as a playfully competitive personality, husband-and-wife Max and Annie are it in spades."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has energy and verve to spare, operating with a sense of comic anarchy that is hard to resist."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is one of those rare mid-tier comedies that has a few laughs, but isn't consistently good enough for a recommendation."
    },
    {
      "text": "The funniest movie of 2018. The character's ignorance of how unintelligent they are and the over-the-top situations the script finds the characters in is tremendously comedic."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the better studio comedies I've seen in a while."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night provides escapist camp, a fun night at the movies. Keep in mind, however, that rationalization should be checked at the door."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie's strongest point are the actors who rise above the average script and make you laugh at their antics throughout."
    },
    {
      "text": "The cast has great chemistry and if you grew up in a competitive family you will be able to relate to it like I did."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's smart and funny, driven by talented actors bringing something real to the table. It has its crass moments and is packed with referential nods, sure, but it's all in service to driving the narrative and making actual jokes."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film blends human drama with well-placed jokes and a decent amount of action to not only create an action comedy, but a comedy that actually works."
    },
    {
      "text": "Just another game night."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is nice surprise from the directors of Vacation, with a fun premise, a capably comedic cast and the improved direction of Daley and Goldstein."
    },
    {
      "text": "This thriller/comedy combination is no masterpiece, especially given it's weak script and off the rails third act, but it is a light fun movie. Jason Bateman's charismatic performance carries the film over the rough spots."
    },
    {
      "text": "The characters are well-written and witty, with some razor-sharp, stinging dialogue. The natural onscreen chemistry of the actors is what elevates the film."
    },
    {
      "text": "GAME NIGHT invests fully in the chemistry and charisma of its actors. The players (no pun intended) do not let them down."
    },
    {
      "text": "A delightful comedy that offers some great comedic bits and a few wonderful surprises."
    },
    {
      "text": "The dynamic direction and the committed performances from the cast help sell a preposterous high concept."
    },
    {
      "text": "Works better in the parts, comedy in the first half and action-drama in the second, than on the whole but still, you can't help but enjoy Game Night."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a genuine (and I mean this nicely) mean streak in \"Game Night\". And the balance of jokes and genuine threat, along with the constant new twists, is nothing short of audacious."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film mixes several different types of comedy, but it manages to maintain the same tone throughout, even as the reveals become ever more ridiculous."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like a good game night, some cinematic adventures require a solid group to truly bring out the magic inherent in the experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "A humdinger of a big studio comedy, never taking itself so seriously that it loses its charms but also being brave enough to indulge in some adult-only jollity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Watching clueless suburbanites stumble around a plot grander & more complex than their own is funny. Abandoning the game night for unsatisfying action set pieces is not funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "The culmination of all these aspects means that Game Night is the kind of comedy that consistently delivers the laughs with astonishing consistency, and never relying on a particular type of gag."
    },
    {
      "text": "The twists and turns are absurd with plot-holes, but we're never inclined to care because the messiness allows the actors to disregard reality and go for broke."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are interesting realities just outside the edges of the film, which would rather move the pieces than tip them over."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night blossomed into a critical and commercial success by absolutely nailing the three most important tenets of film making: casting, writing, and directing."
    },
    {
      "text": "I was so glad to see Rachel McAdams doing comedy again, and she's so entertaining in this."
    },
    {
      "text": "Appreciate the effort to have this aspect of the film serve the 'playing a game' motif, but there's a point where 'ah-ha' becomes 'trying too hard.'"
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night succeeds in creating a night of mystery and debauchery audiences will love."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because of the tightly written script, the funny characters, and cleverly well-choreographed sequences of action, \"Game Night\" is a fun ride."
    },
    {
      "text": "A vulgar, violent, solidly R-rated comedy that is nevertheless sophisticated rather than gross."
    },
    {
      "text": "Packed with delightfully quirky characters and zany plot twists, it's far better and more amusing than the trailer would have you believe."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is a great film and is a must-see for anyone looking to watch something lighthearted and funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "A solid ensemble comedy thriller that inspired some genuine chuckles from me..."
    },
    {
      "text": "A goofy ensemble comedy that also functions as a spoof of middle-class malaise."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hollywood needs to be employing Rachel McAdams for more movies where she gets to show off such physical and verbal comedic timing and prowess."
    },
    {
      "text": "A comedy can only work if the on-screen actors share a talented knack for comedic timing and chemistry. That happens here with McAdams and Bateman, an unlikely comedy dream team that carries \"Game Night\" into glory."
    },
    {
      "text": "As cookie cutter as the trailers for Game Night seemed, the movie did a good job of bringing some enjoyable twists and unexpected turns."
    },
    {
      "text": "What a journey. What a movie. What a Game Night. See it, and buy tickets in advance."
    },
    {
      "text": "With so many different types of comedies, there is plenty of room for a slow boil riot like this one."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is a likeable, funny, and fast-moving caper that delivers on pretty much all levels. It'll make for fantastic couch-watching."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is hardly a game-changer but - with the help of a spirited cast and some inspired sequences - is elevated from pedestrian material into a perfect Friday night popcorn movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Doesn't amount to much, but it'll make a decent rental for a Movie Night, with friends invited over for a breezy, occasionally gory spot of goofiness."
    },
    {
      "text": "Full of hilarious dialog and set-pieces that keep us chortling."
    },
    {
      "text": "This Game Night is a real joy. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "It's surprising how well it works, and how funny it is."
    },
    {
      "text": "The directors care very little about story development. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "It smells like a saga because, let's face it, we want to see Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams again, tumbling between gags and swipes. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "I did have a good laugh all throughout the film though, and for that, I recommend that you go see it."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you came here to laugh, [Game Night] is your option. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "If your game night sometimes turns into movie night, this one should fill the bill nicely - the less you know, the better."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is an unpretentious comedy -but a good one- that manages to surprise. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night isn't exactly revolutionary comedy, but that doesn't take anything away from the fact that it's an insanely fun ride...It actually works as a real mystery whose precise unraveling produces as much wonder as laughs."
    },
    {
      "text": "Is it a thriller? A comedy? A little bit of both, actually, and it mixes both genres in entertaining ways. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "A light, deliciously black, and consistently funny experience. Game Night is one of 2018's greatest surprises so far. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "McAdams, an eternally underrated performer, is the pic's MVP."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bateman and McAdams make \"Game Night\" fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "Aside from the magical pairing of Bateman and McAdams, who should do a string of films together like a modern-day Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, the film's MVP is Jesse Plemons."
    },
    {
      "text": "The decision to mix in some brutal shootings with the expected sexual innuendos and flatulent humour results in an uneven mix which is only vaguely satisfying."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even if the humor in the film is merely pleasant and conventional for the most part, the characters themselves are massively enjoyable."
    },
    {
      "text": "While watching Game Night in a packed theater, I spent my time both laughing and applauding the cinematography. I hope Game Night helps McAdams and Plemons land more much-deserved comedic work."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Game Night\" is a hot mess, but there are those laughs, and they're surely worth something, right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an enjoyable snack, and the guests are good company and don't overstay their welcome during a mostly fun evening."
    },
    {
      "text": "McAdams and Bateman are the movie's only real assets; they're slumming, but they're having fun, and it's contagious."
    },
    {
      "text": "Overall, this is an enjoyable romp that's worth a look - if only to find out whether being a pub quiz ace and having serious skills at Pictionary or Charades can really help you when your up against international criminals."
    },
    {
      "text": "Filmmakers Daley and Goldstein have infused Game Night with a very slick, very fast-paced sensibility that is, at the outset, impossible to resist..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The more you think about it, the less sense it makes.... but that's not to say that you can't have fun watching it."
    },
    {
      "text": "For all its bluster, Game Night isn't really much of anything."
    },
    {
      "text": "From beginning to end it is comedic gold."
    },
    {
      "text": "A great mix between crime thriller and screwball comedy that actually ends up working. Includes a great turn by Rachel McAdams and some impressive direction. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "But some plot points are darker, less luminous, and that's where Game Night fails. It immolates the spirit of comedy by pretending to be something that it isn't. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie is a hollow throwback to classic comedy, and it shines only by contrast with dull studio competition."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night -- a slick, inventive and surprisingly efficient action/comedy -- is as solid a studio chuckle-fest as you could hope to see. Flawed, for sure, but we'll take it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Studio comedies have been so bad for so long that when a halfway decent one comes along, we critics tend to get overexcited. But Game Night is a little better than decent, and handles its commendably silly premise with real skill and charm."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is good, if slightly lightweight fun, albeit with Bateman and McAdams on sharp enough form to make you realise how long it's been since a decent commercial comedy came along."
    },
    {
      "text": "For mainstream laughs, this is better than most."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's some nice deadpanning and comic undercutting from Bateman - his stock in trade, and some visual flourish, but the story's too contrived for its own good."
    },
    {
      "text": "The spoofy action set-pieces are ho hum. What's special is the minutiae-based, casually political banter."
    },
    {
      "text": "This surprisingly zingy, throwback studio comedy is witty and observant on the dynamics between couples."
    },
    {
      "text": "A mostly enjoyable, well-written romp wisely entrusted to the comedic chemistry of Jason Bateman and Rachel McAdams."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is so absurd it's almost surreal, but...it works and never gets dragged down by its own concept."
    },
    {
      "text": "You wouldn't think \"Fincher's The Game, except it's a comedy\" would sustain an entire movie, but it actually does."
    },
    {
      "text": "The closest thing we have seen in recent years to a successful exercise in high screwball."
    },
    {
      "text": "But most of all, \"Game Night\" belongs to Bateman and McAdams. No one can chew on a squeaky toy more humorously than he can, and no one is better at combining comic timing and sex appeal than she."
    },
    {
      "text": "The script by Mark Perez is sharp, and directors Jonathan Goldstein and John Francis Daley do a decent job, aided by some extremely engaging performances."
    },
    {
      "text": "This slippery, cartoonish jape is constantly springing little surprises and knocking you off balance with its unexpected twists."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's clever, silly, slick and fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's properly laugh out loud and easily the best fun I've had at a comedy in ages - mainly due to the fact it's plot is sturdy and original, with more than enough to keep everyone happy."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film not only manages to deliver the goods with its fantastically-crafted comedic narrative, but also succeeds in highlighting what we've been missing these last few years, simple and effective gags delivered with gusto and great timing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bateman and McAdams have enormous chemistry in \"Game Night\"... That energy propels them into two of their funniest performances in a surprisingly clever comedy-thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "This high-concept comedy could have been mediocrity embodied, but it excels in two ways. It sought out an R-rating, so the film noir-inspired action is surprisingly intense -- but the casting is also pitch-perfect, elevating the comedic punches."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the results sometimes tip towards self-indulgence or self-parody, the movie is still far cleverer and more engaging than one had any right to expect."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night turns out to be a cool, clever surprise. The cast crackles-Bateman and McAdams are fast, easy and terrifically enjoyable together-and there's bright, sharp supporting work."
    },
    {
      "text": "[A] combination of comedy and thriller. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Even as Game Night piles on the absurdity and really tries your patience with outlandish twists and turns, it never loses pace or fails to keep pranging your funny bone. Worth a roll of the dice."
    },
    {
      "text": "Delivers all the undemanding laughs you could wish, and has such a plot of such baroque intricacy that it even manages a few genuine shocks."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bateman and McAdams prove to be an effective comedy pairing. .. The two of them play off of each other perfectly."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night takes a long time to get rolling. At least the first third is nothing but drab exposition and characterization...but it has enough well-executed bits to make you hope that John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein keep honing their craft."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although the leads seem perfect on paper ... unusually for both of them, they're trying too hard ... The film spins endless jokes and almost none are funny. It simply reminds you of better films, and in doing so, survives for one hundred minutes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite McAdams and Bateman's winning chemistry, the film slides down the longest ladder mid-way and never finds its way back up - no credit to the script's numerous twists and attempts to outwit itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night offers a well-trod set-up, but the crack cast make this silly comedy work."
    },
    {
      "text": "If only every comedy was as capable of hitting as many marks as Game Night, sequel wouldn't be such a dirty word."
    },
    {
      "text": "The raucous energy of the early scenes isn't sustained and the film becomes increasingly repetitious and silly. The comedy elements here work far better than the thriller ones."
    },
    {
      "text": "... Game Night is a gloriously preposterous comedy/thriller hybrid that pays homage to the oeuvre of David Fincher - a delightfully preposterous thing for an absurdist comedy to do."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a one-note black comedy. But one is better than none, and this note is high, passably sharp and could crack the odd martini glass."
    },
    {
      "text": "At least they looked like they had some fun along the way."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night succeeds where so many other films of this nature suffer: it's funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "Beats a game of Risk any day."
    },
    {
      "text": "The flatness of their characters leaves no room for relatability."
    },
    {
      "text": "Absolutely hilarious, full of smart snarksters, comedic suspense, and gleeful smashing of action-movie clichés. Part screwball comedy, part romantic adventure, all pure movie-movie joy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Want some laughs? Make 'Game Night' your next move."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's very funny, with a script by Mark Perez, and all the pieces fit together like a perfect Rubix cube."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is all bottom-feeder stuff, aimed at people who feel cool because they know what the Independent Spirit Awards are or who watch \"TMZ\" more than they'd like to admit."

      "text": "[Jesse] Plemons steals his scenes, if not the movie."

      "text": "Sometimes it got a little too zany, but then it came back down and it was pretty funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "Remarkably funny, great chemistry among everybody."
    },
    {
      "text": "A tone-friendly dark comedy about suburban couples having weekly game nights at home with chosen friends."
    },
    {
      "text": "Directors John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein keep things peppy, benefitting hugely from a pumped, overqualified ensemble that mine a commendable amount of laughter from a so-so script."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night pulls off more narrative twists than an Olympic freestyle skier. And like those gravity-defying champions, the filmmakers' timing, preparation, and technical precision makes it all look deceptively easy."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its clever, whip-smart script and enthusiastic ensemble cast firing on all cylinders, crime comedy filmmakers Jonathan Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein score big with Game Night."
    },
    {
      "text": "Game Night is canny enough to go full-throttle with the absurd and not bother trying to do much with its meager dramatic and/or sentimental elements."
    },
    {
      "text": "...once you open the box and take out the pieces, it's just a matter of going from one contrived square to another. Not even the rolls of the dice add up to more than three-act narrative math."
    },
    {
      "text": "... boasts an ambitious genre-bending premise and a sharp ensemble cast, only to lack the ability to solve its own convoluted narrative puzzle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Absolutely nutty, buoyed by a wonderfully warped sense of humor and a more-than-game cast that's equal to the film's rapid-fire dialogue and pace, Game Night easily rates as a stunning surprise."
    },
    {
      "text": "Riotously funny little farce that is a certifiable blast and guaranteed to be the best time you've had at the movies this year."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even though during the final act it's difficult not to mentally check out, there's fun to be found in its slightly demented zaniness, all fitted with a dark and electronic score from Cliff Martinez"
    },
