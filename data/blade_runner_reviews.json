      "text": "2049 is able to exist both as a masterful sequel and/or stand-alone film in the universe, which showcases Villeneuve’s massive skill as a storyteller and further validates him as one of the best visionaries of our generation."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the original film’s warmth beneath the cold metropolitan’s structure came from Deckard’s love for Rachel, 2049 extends this ethos to a love and understanding of the self in the greater context of others."
    },
    {
      "text": "Just as in the original, this film is as much about the texture of the world on screen as it is the story of the Replicants 30 years after Deckard first strolled the mean streets of L.A."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much like its predecessor, 2049 is a methodically structured puzzle, solved through slow but persistent drips of revelation."

      "text": "A new chapter. A triumph. A cinematic miracle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Unlike the original film, where the \"romance\" feels like a product of Deckard's dehumanized relationship with Replicants, the romance between Ryan Gosling's K and Ana de Armas' Joi, both machines, feels real and keeps the film intriguing."
    },
    {
      "text": "A skilfully made movie that works as a companion piece to Scott's film and as a detective mystery."
    },
    {
      "text": "Deliberate in its pacing and world-building, the follow-up to Ridley Scott's dystopian vision of Los Angeles uses breathtaking cinematography, impeccable production, and a gripping story to make our second visit even more revelatory than the first."

    {
      "text": "Slow-burn thrillers don't always work, particularly when fused with science-fiction and brief action, but here the finale is a welcome redemption."

    },
    {
      "text": "Blade Runner 2049 can be aggravatingly sparse and sometimes bombastic, taking too much time to say what it wants to. When the pieces fall into place, however, it's spellbinding."

    {
      "text": "The film's running time is hefty, but its pleasures are deep and satisfying. Villeneuve's direction is brilliant, and if Deakins doesn't win an Oscar for this cinematography, the award has no meaning. See it on the largest screen you can find."

    },
    {
      "text": "Echoing a bygone era of studio films daring to push boundaries and expectations rather than demurely adhering to them, Blade Runner 2049 is every bit a soliloquy of dread in response to Scott's ballet of violence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Blade Runner 2049 refines Blade Runner's themes and widens its scope with such immaculate skill and savvy calculation that, ironically, I don't think it could have nearly the same impact as Blade Runner did"
    },
    {
      "text": "Love the sets and trappings, especially of the nightclub with stars from yesteryear, but the film itself is not satisfying and way too long."
    },
    {
      "text": "Blade Runner 2049 was totally not what I expected. Yes, bits of it are dumb. But bits of it are very good, and some bits of it are positively awesome."

      "text": "By syncing so many moving parts into a seamless, spellbinding whole, Blade Runner 2049 is both heady speculative fiction and action thriller at its finest."
    },
    {
      "text": "All told, this feels like the best-case scenario for a sequel three-plus decades in the making: it is a glorious visual evolution of its predecessor that retains only the tones and themes it needs."
    },

      "text": "It does the unthinkable: takes one of the most popular cult films of all time and actually makes a sequel worthy of its name."
    },
    {
      "text": "Villeneuve wisely takes the themes of Scott's Blade Runner and explores them from a new angle, while maintaining fidelity to the world built by its now classic predecessor."
    },
    {
      "text": "Blade Runner 2049 works without the original film. It cultivates mood and atmosphere well. But the original Blade Runner remains in the margins, explicit and implicit, drawing focus."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's unlikely that Blade Runner 2049 will reach the cult status Scott's original film developed, though Villeneuve's effort is a labour of love that certainly deserves its due."

    },
    {
      "text": "Blade Runner 2049 was a solid movie. I think what hurts the movie, however, is not even the film's own fault. The swelled up expectations and anticipation behind the first film loomed over this sequel."

    },
    {
      "text": "Try to see this amazingly visual and immersive film on the largest screen possible. And yes, it will help to see the original first. The world is beautiful, layered and fascinating and the characters keep you caring every one of its 164 minutes."

    },
    {
      "text": "Though thematically ambitious and visually unmatched, Blade Runner 2049 isn't the kind of crowd-pleasing blockbuster filmmaking that routinely packs the multiplexes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Captivating visuals, a haunting score, and a cast that's uniformly at the top of their game make it more of an experience than a film. It's nothing short of an electric dream."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much like the 1982 original, this is a visual marvel - with director Denis Villeneuve meticulously crafting this futuristic world in great detail - although the narrative lacks the same spark."
    },

      "text": "Villeneuve is easily up there with my favorite directors now."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a movie with large spaces that gives us room, both physically and temporally, to let experiences sink in, to enjoy character moments, to worry about danger, and to appreciate nods (large and small) to the earlier film."
    },

      "text": "... it's great to see a director and his crew being given the freedom to be eccentric, contemplative, and create a film that doesn't leave you when you exit the dark hall."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wallace's desire and K's secret are, of course, connected, because in this gorgeous new Blade Runner, the narrative slots neatly together in a way that's tidy but unsatisfying."
    },
    {
      "text": "Directed by Arrival maestro Denis Villeneuve, Blade Runner 2049 is a film that, like all of us-human and replicant alike- actively wrestles with its own existence."
    },

      "text": "Look elsewhere for your fix, action junkies, and don't judge \"2049\" for what it isn't."
    },
    {
      "text": "Small miracles do exist in Blade Runner 2049, but the organic beauty and possibility they represent gets buried beneath ponderous ruminations and plot twists ripped from the pantheon of generic science fiction."
    },
    {
      "text": "The failure of \"Blade Runner 2049\" is how it discriminates between men and women, and how that discrimination surpasses the distinction between human and machine. That failure leaves you with no hope for the future."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "If every new film made today is to a greater or lesser degree an echo box of past possibilities, what's notable is how much Villeneuve gives those echoes room to breathe and to be new."

      "text": "It seems designed to watch itself even if no one showed up, like a rotating hall of mirrors. The film doesn't need us."

    },
    {
      "text": "2049's future feels safer and cleaner, lacking Blade Runner's sensuous grime (there's not a single cloud of cigarette smoke), but its imagery is no less striking, particularly when Villeneuve and Deakins go wide with hypnotic vistas of a decaying Earth."
