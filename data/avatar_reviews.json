    {
      "text": "This is better than the original. Action in the 2nd act is top notch, the voice acting/motion capture is vibrant, characters new & old have more weight/emotion, and the visuals are so good it took my eyes time to truly grasp IMAX 3D High FPS. IT’S SO EPIC"

    },

      "text": "After more than a decade of waiting, Avatar: The Way of Water makes a statement as the most spectacular blockbuster of the year, providing a thrilling ride through the mesmerizing world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hyperbole is maybe the worst thing in the world, but Avatar: The Way of Water utterly redefines visual awe and wonder. It resets the bar so ridiculously high with entire sequences that leave you unsure where physical reality stops and CG begins."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Cameron, like he did with sequels to \"Alien\" and \"Terminator,\" once again proves he is the master of upping the ante in terms of both storytelling and spectacle."
    },
    {
      "text": "The filmmaking craft may be (mostly) astonishing. But the craft must always — <i>always</i> — be in aid of a compelling story populated by compelling characters... and that’s not so much the case here."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cameron has crafted nothing more than a 3+ hour revenge tale with none of the motivations of the original that is nothing more than a dulling $400 million screensaver and a rehashing of better moments from his career. A waste of our time and his effort."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cameron’s always one to push the boundaries, and you’re reminded of that early on if you see it in 3D IMAX. I was quickly in awe of Cameron’s visual storytelling as we return to the lush world of Pandora"
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie’s roaring achievement: There’s cinematic genius in every overdetermined frame, every animated motion in shifting frame rates, the relentless photorealistic detail. The sensation is like being trapped in a bathysphere in an aquarium."
    },
    {
      "text": "If it hasn’t already been advised by Disney, Avatar’s captain just really needs to either learn to let go or be locked out of the editing room on the next one. Even the most jaw-dropping of action sequences seem stretched or recur unnecessarily.."

    },
    {
      "text": "It’s not that this is a bad movie, it really isn’t, it just felt soulless. Its attempt to create something profound thematically and narratively falls short and the band of characters sadly just aren’t that interesting - but, hey, at least it looks good."

    },
    {
      "text": "It would be missing the point to call the proceedings indulgent to the point of self-infatuation: Cameron has built a new world from the remixed bits of this one, and he seems determined that we should not simply visit Pandora, we should live in it."
    },
    {
