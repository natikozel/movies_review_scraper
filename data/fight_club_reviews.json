    {
      "text": "David Fincher's prescient rumination on manhood at the close of the 20th century was a revolutionary movie about revolutionary men in a time of complacence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fight Club feels like a declaration of artistic intent with an axe to grind. It comes across as a tour de force from director David Fincher, and aggressively courts controversy whilst remaining a truly riveting piece of work"
    },
    {
      "text": "From the guitar roar on the Dust Brothers' opening title track through to the thundering drums of Pixies' Where Is My Mind? it is pure synapse-splitting sensory overload and the road that commercial cinema refused to take."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fight Club did indeed fly over the heads of audiences expecting straight macho action thrills, as opposed to a mind-messing critique of the same, as well as capitalism, material acquisition, masculinity and other sacred cows of national identity."

      "text": "Fight Club is very, very, very good."

      "text": "With an absolutely brilliant direction and execution, David Fincher uses Jim Uhls’ captivating, layered, unconventional screenplay to tackle themes such as consumerism, society’s behavior, and mental health."

      "text": "The first rule of Fight Club, as we're constantly reminded, might not be to talk about it, but once seen, it is most certainly not forgotten, even 22 years on."

    {
      "text": "Let's not get away from the fact that Fight Club is awesome."
    },
    {
      "text": "David Fincher is an interesting director whose films more often than not work for me, Fight Club is a notable exception."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shocking violence, utter chaos, spirited editing, and mindfuck finales can be found elsewhere. Pitt haranguing a squirrelly Norton everyman on consumerist ideals, however, is forever."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's bold, it's gritty, it's rebellious, it's unapologetic, it takes risks, and it's narrator reflects the frustrations of many people."
    },

      "text": "Perhaps it is postmodern filmmaking, whatever that means. In any case, Fight Club remains the ugliest, most inhuman film since Natural Born Killers."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film's tongue is far too firmly in its cheek at all points of its discourse to ever take its characters' actions too much at face value."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie demands a certain attention and is not easily dismissed, but there is something deeply unsettling about a work that uncritically espouses brutality as a function of alienation and nonconformity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Pitt dominates the screen every second he's on it, and it simultaneously represents his weirdest, funniest and most charismatic role of his career."

    },
    {
      "text": "An outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload, Fight Club is the most incendiary movie to come out of Hollywood in a long time. It's a mess, but one worth fighting about."

    {
      "text": "Just when it's supposedly getting to grips with its theme, the movie goes utterly haywire and becomes yet another brainless, humourless bone-cruncher."

    },
    {
      "text": "Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel student pub debates for years."
    },
    {
      "text": "A controversial satire and a contemporary classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is working American Beauty-Susan Faludi territory, that illiberal, impious, inarticulate fringe that threatens the smug American center with an anger that cannot explain itself, can act out its frustrations only in inexplicable violence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Blistering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology."

    },
    {
      "text": "We're meant to take the male bonding and the blood rituals as a protest against the sterility of corporate life and modern design, but Fincher's sadomasochistic kicks overwhelm any possible social critique."

    },
    {
      "text": "I don't mind a film with a surprise ending but, rather than enhancing the film, the climactic revelation in Fight Club cancels out everything previously seen. In fact, the bitter end of the film is a hypocritical cop-out."

      "text": "An exciting, dangerous, and intense story."
    },

      "text": "It might not be as controversial as it was back in 1999, but it's definitely just as relevant."
    },
    {
      "text": "Durden is so intense, focused and honestly violent that the messianic hold he has on his followers is palpable. It's one of the best things that Pitt has done and his performance helps to recommend the film."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the greatest films ever made"
    },
    {
      "text": "Pitt bronco-rides through the movie, using many of the nutsy-dangerous mannerisms he previously unloosed in 12 Monkeys. It's the performance you'd expect Pitt to give, and still you can't take your eyes off it."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Lobs punishing combinations at the flabby midsection of life in the 1990s. But as the film wears on, it's apparent that Fincher can't deliver the knockout blow."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a strange, agonized film--a darkly comic end-of-the-millennium fable with unforgettable performances and visuals. The writing is tight, smart and edgy; there's no question it hits a chord with our consumer-crazed lifestyle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Undermines any seriousness it might have harbored with an avalanche of smirky cynicism designed to flatter the hipper-than-thou fantasies of adolescent moviegoers."
    },
    {
      "text": "If it had all continued in the vein explored in the first act, it might have become a great film. But the second act is pandering and the third is trickery."

    },
    {
      "text": "Although Pitt's acting brilliance comes through loud and clear in his most unsympathetic role to date, Fight Club belongs to Norton."
    },
    {
      "text": "If \"A Clockwork Orange\" was a bitter answer to the \"all you need is love\" message of the late 1960s, \"Fight Club\" is a brass-knuckled slap in the face to yuppiedom and its \"greed is good\" mantra."
    },
    {
      "text": "Delivers a sucker punch to the audience and then pulls the rug out from under it. It is sensational."

      "text": "This is movie that sears the nerves, that immediately draws a line in the dirt and demands that you stand on one side or the other."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you like movies like \"NBK\" and \"RD\" then you must see this movie. If you don't have a strong stomach and don't like violence. Stay home. Trust me on this."

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "Instead of a nasty story with life lessons, what we have is testosterone-driven lunatics who enjoy pain, the sight of blood, and hearing bones crunch. David Cronenberg might have succeeded with the material -- David Fincher doesn't."
    },
    {
      "text": "An unhinged mess of a movie, with potentially dangerous ideas handled in a winking, cynical manner."
    },
    {
      "text": "While one would not expect a film to include the sort of psychological and political analysis of Dostoyevsky's The Possessed, its total absence leaves the viewer with an inability to understand their motivations."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie may not float like a butterfly and sting like a bee, but Fight Club lands its share of haymakers."
