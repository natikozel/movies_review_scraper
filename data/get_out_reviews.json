    },
    {
      "text": "Of course, the social message of the movie wouldn't carry much weight if it wasn't so well made. It's not scary so much as it is tense and unnerving, its paranoid horror elements handled well by first-time writer-director Jordan Peele."

    },
    {
      "text": "With great buzz and nearly universal acclaim, critics may worry about overselling Get Out. But the film truly is one of the funniest comedies, scariest horror films, and most assured cinematic debuts in recent memory."

    },
    {
      "text": "The film has clever ideas about literalizing black fear of the pathology of whiteness, but it doesn't go far enough in its indictment of white supremacy."
    },
    {
      "text": "The tightly wound plot unspools with expert control. Some elements are guessable, but there are also fantastically judged reveals which balance the audience on a knife edge of possibility, creating visceral tension and even panic."

    {
      "text": "Suffice it to say Get Out does a good job weaving together traditional horror tropes with pointed satire about racism."
    },
    {
      "text": "Intelligent and intense, Get Out lingers long after the credits roll. It is one of those rare films that has \"instant classic\" written all over it."

    {
      "text": "This movie could've been a trailblazing original commentary on race relations. It's a good idea, but it's poorly executed."

    },
    {
      "text": "The best horror films...[turn] abstract unease into concrete terror. The material(istic) monsters of Get Out are rich, suburban white people. I know--they freak me out too."
    },
    {
      "text": "Get Out winks at centuries of painful history and honors it with an absurdist de-pantsing of race in America."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "The horror of Get Out is not only the events that take place, but also the racism that fuels these events. Jordan Peele skillfully takes on a serious social issue in a unique light that results in a thrilling film dripping with dark humor."

    },
    {
      "text": "What Peele accomplishes in this film is so far above what your everyday horror film is capable of. In fact, few films have the ability to open up discourse."
    },
    {
      "text": "Get Out didn't solve problems, but it gave an idea pictures-representation of a kind. What more could you ask from a movie?"
    },
    {
      "text": "For black viewers, it is like their very own version of Dante's Inferno; for white viewers, it forces us to question our own complicity."

    {
      "text": "This brilliantly provocative first feature from comic turned writer-director Jordan Peele proves that the best way to get satire to a mass audience is to call it horror."
    },
    {
      "text": "Get Out brings humour into the horror-thriller realm. By adding the laughs, Get Out adds a flair of fun and an odd sense of realism."

      "text": "I laughed, I jumped, I didn't cry... but what a way to come out the gate."
    },
    {
      "text": "Where the film fails is in the actual structure of the story, which is riddled with inconsistencies, gaping holes in the plot, and what seems to be a mid-point shift from one story to a completely different one."
    },
    {
      "text": "Everything in Get Out seems innocuous on first blush."
    },
    {
      "text": "Funny, tense, clever and assured, Get Out speaks to the lie of the \"post-racial\" world without ever letting the white part of its audience off the hook."

    },
    {

      "text": "A tasty performance from Kaluuya, together with Catherine Keener and Bradley Whitford as the parents, but Peele is the star find here."
    },
    {
      "text": "Peele's parting thought is not to insist that we are destined to be slaves to the narrow thinking of others, but that we have a responsibility to remain cautious and vocal until such ideas have been destroyed. Get Out is an urgent call to that necessity."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you like to be scared, if you like to laugh, and if you like to learn a thing or two at the movies, this absolutely cannot be missed."
    },
    {
      "text": "In using both realities in his movie, Peele brings Get Out to a higher level of horror, at least for any person of color in the audience. We're all keenly aware of how possible it is."
