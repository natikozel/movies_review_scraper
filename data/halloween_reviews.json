      "text": "What differentiates Halloween from its worst copycats, though, is that its narrative decisions were made because they made sense for its characters, and not because they were considered staples of the genre."
    },
    {
      "text": "It’s left largely to the cast to lend the film personality, which they do in spades: Jamie Lee Curtis’s casting was almost accidental (Carpenter wanted someone else) but the film might not have worked at all without her grounding, relatable presence."
    },
    {
      "text": "If he is the Boogeyman, the Reaper, Death, she is the counterforce sharing some of his characteristics, but only using them for good. Unlike Michael, who is mad by societal terms, but exhibits no emotion, Laurie is emotional, and violence affects her."
    },
    {
      "text": "...  a beautifully-made made picture by a director who brings a visual intelligence to a genre that was so often reduced to hack directors and gimmicks in place of storytelling."

    {
      "text": "There's nothing like Carpenter's original..."

    {
      "text": "A favorite of both the Film Comment set and the Fangoria crowd because, at heart, it’s a minimalist art film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even 40 years later, this proves to be a timeless classic. Carpenter shows his early greatness at executing a simple, yet frightening, concept with style and excellence. Michael Myers is an icon and it's all because of this original gem."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film set the standard for horror and the slasher film genre and is one of the most influential, imitated, and commercially successful independent films in history."

    {
      "text": "Halloween is a cipher that moviegoers, critics, and film scholars have filled in with countless readings."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is meticulously made, with every decision working to craft the stylistic, iconic film many of us hold so dear."
    },
    {
      "text": "The best moments of Halloween take their lead from its exemplary opening: that iconically spare musical score-cum-leitmotif, and the film's slippery command of perspective."
    },
    {
      "text": "Carpenter's meticulously crafted film doesn't waste a single second, the gold standard of the slasher genre with its most effective score."

    {
      "text": "Carpenter's 1978 slasher classic has inspired a million imitations as well as sequels, but few that demonstrate so clearly that a disreputable genre movie can also be a pure, rigorous work of art."
    },
    {
      "text": "In horror, the jack-in-the-box scare... is the quickest way to get a scream, but the still shocks... are the ones that linger with you. \"Halloween\" has them both, but it specializes in the second."

      "text": "Filmmaker Carpenter certainly does an effective job of immediately drawing the viewer into the proceedings..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The horror genre can often (rightfully) be maligned. Many of the films within the genre are cheap exploitation films, whose filmmakers care more about monetary return than crafting a great movie."

    },
    {
      "text": "Why Halloween works is because even in its minute flaws, there's an inherent charm to the basic effectiveness and fundamental workmanship on display & it's hard to say that about many films who have tried to follow in its footsteps ever since."
    },
    {
      "text": "Carpenter obviously knows the genre well and he builds a properly terrifying atmosphere through his well-paced direction. It's an effective entry for its intended market."

    },
    {
      "text": "To call Halloween merely brilliant isn't giving it enough credit. As a horror film and as a historical milestone that single-handedly shaped and altered the future of an entire genre, it's downright transcendent."

      "text": "Who could have predicted that the low-budget pic Halloween would have a profound influence on an industry, not to mention on the concept of Halloween itself?"

    {
      "text": "If Donald Pleasance tells you something is important, you should listen to him."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the best horror films ever made. John Carpenter deserves a medal for his effective build-up of suspense, his knack for casting and his sensationally-scary Michael Myers!"
    },

      "text": "Halloween brilliantly uses its widescreen frame, a lot of hand-held camerawork, and scary foreground and background action."

      "text": "It's hard to get behind a main character who's so unexciting. But maybe Michael Myers is the real main character. In which case, mission accomplished: I'm freaked out."

    {
      "text": "Even after repeated viewings, Carpenter's minor masterpiece holds up as a staunchly effective thriller that will always stand head and shoulders above the cinematic progeny it spawned."

    {
      "text": "It's freaking scary. After a recent viewing, I was charged with going through the house and turning on all the lights."
    },
    {
      "text": "Since there is precious little character or plot development to pass the time between stalking sequences, one tends to wish the killer would get on with it."

    {
      "text": "very possibly no other seminal seventies film--not The Godfather, not Star Wars, perhaps not even Jaws--has had a greater influence on popular culture."

      "text": "A real trick and treat. Genuinely creepy stuff."
    },
    {
      "text": "They should have broken the mold when they released Halloween, for when it comes to escaped-maniacs-on-the-loose films this one's the real deal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Effective little thriller, but about as far from a great classic as you can get."

    {
      "text": "Halloween (1978) is a genuinely scary, stylistic and tasteful, extremely well-crafted slasher/horror classic from young film director John Carpenter"
    },
    {
      "text": "Responsible for jump-starting Jamie Lee Curtis's career, this one so thoroughly and thoughtfully exploited American angst that it's no wonder we had to sit through a slew of derivative slasher flicks for the better part of the next decade."
