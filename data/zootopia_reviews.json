    },
    {
      "text": "For all the animal antics on display here, the movie also gently broaches all-too-human issues of stereotyping, prejudice and racism. This is something worthwhile to chew over, even for younger audiences."

      "text": "If the film is superficially great, a plastered-over screenplay lurks just beneath, poking its ugly head out early and often."
    },
    {
      "text": "What's so clever about Zootopia is it takes the normal feel-good positive messages, this time about not judging people by their sex or race, and mixes it with something more mature, a vintage Los Angeles-like crime noir."

    },
    {
      "text": "There's rarely been so much sub in the text of an animated movie, and while it makes Zootopia a surprisingly thought provoking experience, there's also something slightly disconcerting about Disney's willingness to so keenly embrace adult themes."
