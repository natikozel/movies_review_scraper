    {
      "text": "Sublime without becoming overly sentimental, Invisible Life plays out like Douglas Sirk by way of Todd Haynes with a dash of Claire Denis."
    },
    {
      "text": "I really wanted to like this film. I’m a sucker for horror where reality is taken out of our control, and it feels like the world is turning off its axis... As with many things in the film, the intention is clear, but the execution is wanting."

      "text": "Sure nothing beats the original Invisible Man from 1933, but this new take on a classic is very entertaining."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Leigh Whannell crafted a genuinely scary and extremely suspenseful horror movie, based on a traumatic real-life situation that a lot of people, unfortunately, go through. Elisabeth Moss delivers an emotionally powerful performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Under Whannell’s direction, the camera is virtually a separate character, often turning away from Cecilia as if it’s seeing something she can’t, directing our gaze in a way that draws us into her nightmare."

      "text": "Whether it’s being an edge-of-your-seat horror thriller or a stinging allegory of domestic violence and the quest of women to be heard, “The Invisible Man” hits all of its targets."

    {
      "text": "... It uses its serious theme to give extra force to a tale that already has plenty of flair as a pure and simple spine-chiller."

    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man keeps the viewer disrupted and disturbed from the beginning to the very end. Whannell brings the feeling of uneasiness and agitation to the forefront, constructing an incredibly thought-through story."

      "text": "Imbues its classic horror story with real-life terror."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though influenced by the earlier film, Writer-Director Leigh Whannell reworks outdated elements and comes up with a surprisingly relevant take on the powers provided by invisibility."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's fast and violent but crystalline in clarity...letting us experience the violence, shame, confusion, and anger that Cecilia does rather than explaining it to us."

    },
    {
      "text": "This film - with its science-fiction slant - delivers scares and works as a heightened examination of obsession and an abusive relationship."
    },
    {
      "text": "Leigh Whannell's update of the classic concept stars Elisabeth Moss as the ex-girlfriend of a millionaire inventor turned high-tech gaslighter whose goal is to erase his victim's humanity as effectively as he has obscured his own visibility."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film falls into stale traps, ones so basic and obvious that it's almost maddening to see them regurgitated for yet another rote thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "With some great acting and solid storytelling, The Invisible Man has only strengthened the legacy of Wells' story."

    },
    {
      "text": "Staring, waiting, preparing for the worst creates the most unease in the viewer ... Whannell's script is equal parts action, suspense and surprise. He doesn't go for the easy scare, and much of the film is anxiety-inducing, not seat-jumping."

      "text": "Anchored by a raw performance from Elisabeth Moss, The Invisible Man cements Leigh Whannell's spot in the horror directors' Hall of Fame."
    },
    {
      "text": "I may not have seen every invisible man remake and sequel there is, but of all the ones I have seen this is the best, even better than the original 1933 classic starring Claude Rains (which nevertheless was a technological marvel for its day)."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anchored by another awesome performance by Moss, this urgently topical reworking of the HG Wells tale is a terrifically gripping thriller - and a brilliant metaphor for hidden coercive control."

      "text": "Remarkably intense, consistently clever, and full of characters worth caring about, this is one of the best \"studio\" horror films in recent years."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hodge, Reid and Dyer are competent adjuncts. The movie makes use of conventional horror tropes, while Wallfisch's pounding score borders on the hysterical...but Invisible Man doesn't have anything even vaguely radical or oppositional about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man is a masterpiece of suspense. Less is definitely more when invisibility is the premise of the film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Moss communicates with her bulging blue eyes the terror of past trauma, the panic of being systematically tyrannised, the helplessness of not being believed, and the courage to take her tyranniser down head on."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fear of the unknown is what drives us to be afraid, not fear of the thing itself. The Invisible Man, regrettably, fails to realise this"
    },
    {
      "text": "Whannell puts a brilliant spin on this character that I've honestly felt has never been used to his full potential... It could quite possibly be the single best Universal Monster revival film we've ever had."
    },
    {
      "text": "You have to see it to believe it, but it's a rare remake that actually works, chilling in all the right ways and infusing enough modern sensibility for our current social climate."
    },
    {
      "text": "At last, we have up-to-date evidence that it's perfectly possible to make a new version of a classic story that neither tinkers unnecessarily, nor departs entirely from the tone and content which made the story so good in the first place."
    },
    {
      "text": "Who knew that a \"remake\" could be so refreshing? Leigh Whannel's 3rd turn in the director's chair feels refreshing, borrowing elements of the Universal Monster as a threat anchor. The Invisible Man, at its core, is a woman's cry for escape."
    },
    {
      "text": "It might seem hard to believe, but there's a horror-movie remake that actually isn't an embarrassment to the original film."

      "text": "Leigh Whannell kicks off the re-envisioned Monster Universe with a hyper-intense modern-twist on a classic story."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is not only a horror film that will cause you to grip your chair in fear but will also make you think about it on the car ride home, while having dinner, and when you're lying in bed."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man is a refreshing take on this Universal Classic Monster with a modern twist. It's a terrorizing look into abusive relationships and just how far someone could go to stay in control, becoming the villain hidden in plain sight."
    },
    {
      "text": "No doubt about it: the movie works. And it works on a nasty personal level; it exploits our awareness that women are gaslighted by abusive men all the time, to perpetuate and add to the abuse."
    },
    {
      "text": "I appreciated the simple fact that Whannell's film was legitimately scary while meaning something in the end. It's not made out of fluff or easy frights."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whannell's ruthlessly efficient script invests the story with some real resonance."

    },
    {
      "text": "With this reimagining, Universal Pictures has done several things right."
    },
    {
      "text": "Very tame version of an Entity-type premise, without inventiveness or interest."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man  is much more than the reboot of a classic, it is the reinvention of a monster from a much more real and modern perspective -- making it infinitely more terrifying. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man is a fresh, modern take on a classic horror film that is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll probably enjoy how this film feels more like an experience given the collective paranoia that is offered."
    },
    {
      "text": "Almost halfway through the film, I was worried that it was going in a direction that would make me hate the story - but thankfully, that wasn't the case. Whannel turns the story around with a terrifying action sequence which clarifies the arc ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It builds a generous helping of dread through universally understandable fears - and ones that will strike a particular nerve with victims of abuse."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whannell the screenwriter still has some catching up to do with Whannell the director. But his spiffy remake is mostly able to sustain that sweet spot between cheap thrills and sobering drama."
    },
    {
      "text": "Never lives up to its magnificent opening sequence."
    },
    {
      "text": "The most dazzling aspect of The Invisible Man is the long stretches of silence where the visual grammar forces viewers to really analyze what's happening in the frame."
    },
    {
      "text": "Proves an old classic can get dusted off to be a completely relevant and timely thriller that's worth seeing for a new generation."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man is an effective horror thriller that utilizes outstanding special effects, a chilling storyline, and a strong performance from Elisabeth Moss."
    },

      "text": "The truth is, we own nothing but ourselves and it's that which serves as a glorious jumping off point for writer/director Leigh Whannell's The Invisible Man remake, now available on home video."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film plays like a roller coaster, going through twists and turns that will leave you breathless."
    },
    {
      "text": "The tension never lets up, and you will be on your seat every frame of the film. An award-worthy film for Elizabeth Moss!"
    },
    {
      "text": "Leigh Whannell's approach on H. G. Wells classic adds some interesting contemporary elements, but near the end everything gets quite tangled on a flimsy third act."
    },
    {
      "text": "It was very well-done. The acting was solid."
    },
    {
      "text": "Really entertaining, and I was really surprised by it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Writer-director Leigh Whannell takes the basis of H.G. Wells' 1897 novel of \"The Invisible Man\" and gives it a Hitchcockian-like psychological horror-thriller spin made relevant for today's #MeToo era."
    },
    {
      "text": "Neither as misanthropic nor maniacal as the original, this update finds a happy medium between entropy and empathy. It's the right ground to claim for a shrewd, sleek and truly scary story that knows trauma can't be erased but it can be empowering."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a lot more to think about than a typical horror film. It's a real psychological thriller...a good strong film, not SCARY scary, but it gets in your head."

      "text": "It's more than meets the eye, in all the best ways."
    },
    {
      "text": "The things that I really loved the most about it are the cinematography and the direction."
    },
    {
      "text": "Elisabeth Moss is magnificent, as she plays the part of \"Cecilia Kass\" in this high intensity, edge of your seat, thrilling, gas lighting roller coaster."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man 2020 remake takes a classic thriller and somehow makes it better. It's perfectly updated for the times & brings light to domestic abuse."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Invisible Man forces us to ask if we are so quick to type #believewomen, if held to those words in a real-life Cece v. Adrian situation?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The prize asset is Moss, of course, a seven-octave actor equally happy with micro-emotion and going very big indeed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Moss, so attuned to the nuances of trauma in the early going, devolves into revenge movie clichés. There's nothing wrong with an old-fashioned horror flick, but it's frustrating to watch a film make a grab for greatness and end up grasping only air."
    },
    {
      "text": "In their re-imagined The Invisible Man, filmmaker Leigh Whannell and actress Elisabeth Moss attack the patriarchy and affirm rich white tech bros as the enemy."

      "text": "But \"The Invisible Man,\" alas, comes off as underpopulated, unpersuasive and cheap."
    },
    {
      "text": "A dark, fairly grounded and relentlessly unnerving thriller about domestic-abuse and psychological torment that's aiming hard for the 'subtext that's also just text' style of topical horror."
    },
    {
      "text": "I still feel the trailer showed way too much of the plot, but there is more here than you expect and the scares and chills are frequent and effective."
    },
