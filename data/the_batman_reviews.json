      "text": "Loved every single aspect of this film; the cinematography, that score!!, performances and the story. Easily one of the BEST Batman iterations."

      "text": "A combination of Pattinsons faultless delivery and an engaging storyline from Reeves and Craig give this new interpretation the edge over Zack Snyders overly stylised representation of the DC hero. I just wish it had been slightly shorter."

      "text": "This isnt quite like any previous version of Batman, and thats a good thing; Reeves and Pattinson have fashioned a grim, desperate super-hero thats largely in line with todays hardscrabble times."
    },
    {
      "text": "Matt Reeves has outdone Christopher Nolan in presenting a realistic take on the source material without appearing ashamed of its comic book origins. It is the most like a \"real movie\" any comic book adaptation has felt in ages."

      "text": "Registers among the best of the genre, even if — or more aptly, because — what makes the film so great is its willingness to dismantle and interrogate the very concept of superheroes."

    {
      "text": "In terms of tone and scope and storyline, Matt Reeves’ reboot of the ever-fruitful franchise is more of a film noir than a fable about fantastic flying creatures, more Zodiac and Seven than Guardians of the Galaxy or Eternals."

      "text": "The material here isnt exactly Agatha Christie, but its refreshing to see a superhero film in which the characters take time to think the plot through and in which the plot is worth thinking about."
