    },
    {
      "text": "Cooper saw that A Star is Born was long in the tooth but had good bones -- so he turned a worn-out TCM staple into a hot-blooded, vitally relevant picture. Everything old is new again. You could even say it's been re-born."

    },
    {
      "text": "Ambitious in scope and intimate in execution, it's a film from which two stars are in fact born - Gaga the dramatic actor and Cooper the director."

    },
    {
      "text": "The third remake of this decades-old Hollywood tale has a lot on its mind about art and fame in the modern age. Yet it also crafts an old-fashioned, touchingly tragic love story."
    },
    {
      "text": "Another remake of one of my favorite films. Bradley Cooper doesn't quite pull it off, but everyone around him shines, especially Lady Gaga. The script faltered as did all of the songs -- except The Shallows, which will stick in your head for weeks."
    },
    {
      "text": "A melodramatic, overstuffed, cornball of a movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "The story may have begun as a cautionary tale about Hollywood fame, but even set in the music industry, the ending has a kind of emotional potency only film can achieve."

      "text": "A beautiful movie with amazing performances. A must watch for anyone."
    },
    {
      "text": "One cannot help but be swept up both by the romance and the amount of talent on display."
    },
    {
      "text": "offers proof that remakes are not always evidence of artistic bankruptcy and a dearth of new ideas, but can be invigorating updates to time-honored stories that approach the edge of myth"
    },
    {
      "text": "El consagratorio trabajo actoral de Lady Gaga - y algunos buenos duetos como \"Shallow\" - hacen que las más de dos horas de Nace una estrella sean tolerables aun cuando sentimos que ya hemos visto esta misma película muchas otras veces."

    },
    {
      "text": "Transposed into the era of sudden fame and instant shame, the film glistens as a cautionary tale about self-respect, self-delusion and self-destruction...what is especially admirable is the film's fidelity to the original's heart-breaking final reel."

    },
    {
      "text": "All Cooper and Gaga do is repeat a self-congratulatory Hollywood motto about artists \"having something to say.\" Now is the wrong time for that."
