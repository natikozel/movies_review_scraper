      "text": "We expect brand new stories from Disney, and not forced exhumes via infinite and unnecessary sequels and remakes. Frozen II is a well told tale, but its fault is contingent, and lies in the machine that runs it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II marks a rarity among Disney sequels: not just as one of the few theatrical follow-ups, but as a film that gorgeously and acutely embodies the immaculate, musical heart of its predecessor, while also sharing ideas of its own."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II maintains the values of its predecessor, brotherhood and love between sisters. Sisterhood is a fundamental value since unlike some reigns portrayed in other stories, Anna and Elsa never fight for the throne or power, they are not greedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II compensates for the six-year wait with a follow-up worthy of standing up to its original, which in my opinion, surpasses it. It really feels like a magical film."
    },
    {
      "text": "We also get amazing songs like Into The Unknown, Some Things Never Change, Show Yourself and of course Lost in the Woods. They're easily on par with Let It Go, Do You Want to Build a Snowman and For the First Time in Forever."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II has affable intentions, but overall it fails to meet the expectations set by its predecessor, and it lacked real substance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Just when you think Frozen II shows signs of doing something bold or confronting, it pulls back to a commercial safe zone, supplying Disney with an excuse to further their empire with future sequels and a reliable franchise."

      "text": "So well done... it was just a beautiful experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "The plot of the sequel is both convoluted and familiar."
    },
    {
      "text": "While its music, visual effects, and general spectacle will wow audiences, it's nice to know that Disney is still maintaining the responsibility of exploring change in their stories through diverse ways."
    },
    {
      "text": "You will probably either laugh or cringe. I laughed out loud. And, yes, Olaf (Josh Gad) gets plenty of opportunities to entertain us, including a song that hilariously recaps what happened in the first film."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film's answers and resolutions may end up feeling too vague or abstract, but this bold and sensory approach to storytelling is something that I hope to see more of from Disney."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like most sequels, Frozen II doesn't quite live up to the first film, but it's far from a waste of time. If nothing else, it's nice to be able to spend some more time with the engaging characters of Arendelle."
    },
    {
      "text": "The beauty of this sequel is that it is more intricate than the first, namely in plot. It ditches the simplicity of what boiled down to repairing a sister-sister relationship and opts instead for lofty, complicated concepts in a children's movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it's usually difficult to surpass the original, this broader, more engaging follow up to the wildly successful original speaks more to the power of togetherness than its predecessor even considered."

      "text": "Pleasant and enjoyable but unlikely to leave much of a mark."
    },
    {
      "text": "Disney's 'Frozen 2' far exceeds the original animated film. The character development, storyline and the overall themes are more nuanced, detailed and intriguing. There are some scenes that may insight fear in smaller kids, but overall it's kid-friendly."

      "text": "Disney has managed an impressive act of tightrope walking in following up their latest golden goose with something that shimmers almost as brightly"

      "text": "They try to throw a lot at you, but very little is focused."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a whole lot of charm in this, but it follows the original's winning formula a little too closely that it feels almost repetitive."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although the sequel is no match with the 2013 original, \"Frozen II\" remains a decent sequel that - at least, thankfully - doesn't feel like a blatant cash grab after all."

    },
    {
      "text": "It makes the world of Frozen feel infinite, even if the characters and the story make it feel like it's a small world after all. Perhaps I should just let it go."

    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II may not deliver the same love and energy of the first film, but with extraordinary animation, positive messages, and our beloved Olaf, it's still a film for Frozen fans to see."

      "text": "...a torturously convoluted extension of an already complicated narrative."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II still feels like the market-demanded sequel we know it to be. However, it's worth noting that despite the parts of it that were more than likely the result of studio notes, there's still an emotional core worth appreciating."
    },
    {
      "text": "So Frozen 2's attempts to evolve may not be entirely successful. So Frozen 2 seems like it's doing too much. There's something endearing about watching it try, and stumble, and try again."

    },
    {
      "text": "Fans of Frozen may have had to wait six years for the return of their beloved Elsa and Anna but the wait proves worth it with this dark but empowering sequel."

      "text": "The whole is far from perfect, but the good does outweigh the bad like its predecessor. [And] human compassion reigns supreme."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bit lesser than the previous film and, perhaps blessedly for all the parents out there, the songs are not quite as catchy, but Frozen 2 does world building quite well and earns high marks for charm."
    },

      "text": "Frozen II settles with simply continuing its story. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "A pleasant family entertainment that doesn't reach the high notes of its predecessor. The spectacle and most of the humor compensates for a story that feels too convoluted and simplistic at the same time. [Full review in Spanish]"

    {
      "text": "The excess in singing in this film is a bit fastidious, but it does give the film a feel more akin to literature than something cinematic. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "There's magic here, and elemental spirits, but no magic and nothing elemental, metaphorically speaking. Rote and smaller than its predecessor. Even the songs are bland and forgettable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Disney works its magic again with a sequel that outperforms the original. The actors, the animation, and especially the songs - it is all amazing. I'm just waiting to hear 4 year olds break into \"Into the Unknown\"!!!!!"
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II has some charming moments and the returning vocal cast are in pleasing form, but there's something unwise in separating the characters so much."

      "text": "A gorgeous film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Beautifully realised, with a terrific soundtrack (yes, better than last time)."

    {
      "text": "This first viewing looks gorgeous and Olaf is my hero, but the story lacked the magic of its predecessor..."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm glad to report that, while it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first tale, Frozen 2 is a fabulous follow-up that both children and their caregivers should warmly embrace."
    },
    {
      "text": "Overall 'Frozen 2' was decent, but a little clunky in places. While the soundtrack wasn't as memorable as the first one, the animation is incredible, and Disney just keep improving in that aspect."
    },
    {
      "text": "The plotting of Frozen 2 is arguably too busy (and a mite too dark) for its own good, with a lot of chatter about death, mortality, tribal prejudices, and even alternate dimensions piled on for no discernible, franchise-expanding reason."

      "text": "Disney's hottest 'toon is back for a sequel that is not quite as magical as the first but still blissfully musical."
    },
    {
      "text": "As someone who didn't love the first film, I was nervous going into Frozen 2. Thankfully, this works as a better musical than the first, which makes it a better film."
    },
    {
      "text": "A sequel that's entertaining but doesn't capture the clear purpose and power of the original."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II often doesn't feel like a movie as much as a chess match, with the characters being shoved all around the board with studied precision."
    },
    {
      "text": "Going in, expecting a finely-tuned toy advertisement, and instead getting bonkers nonsense with some fine songs and Elsa ice-surfing, is unpredictable, and unpredictable in this case is to be celebrated."
    },
    {
      "text": "Enough about it works to give fans a reasonable degree of entertainment. Still, there's no denying that it's a big step down from the original."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II isn't the achievement that its predecessor was, it's still pretty darned good. Better than it had to be, really...this new installment will likely prove just as beloved as the first."
    },
    {
      "text": "It gives us more of Elsa, Anna, Olaf, and the rest of the \"Frozen\" favs. But beyond nostalgia, it's ultimately a series of pretty portraits hung around a rather rudderless story."
    },
    {
      "text": "Dazzling animation as the sisters' story - and this lucrative franchise - continues..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even better than the first Frozen, Frozen 2 is the best animated feature of the year and an impressive follow-up."
    },
    {
      "text": "It eventually lands on something that works pretty well... The first half, though, feels like the movie has to restart very nearly every single time it changes locations."
    },
    {
      "text": "While not quite hitting the emotional peaks of Frozen, Frozen II comes close enough...In all, they've done a splendid job replicating the atmosphere and joy of the first film while developing the lore around its cast of beloved characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen 2 doesn't quite recapture the magic of its predecessor but it's a perfectly serviceable follow-up."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, the characters are still charming, and yes, the animation is stunning. But you know there's a problem when the movie includes three different sequences that either just describe favorite moments from the previous movie or straight-up re-runs them."
    },
    {
      "text": "It more than lives up to its predecessor's reputation, with an ambitious and emotional story at its icy (in a good way) heart; and 90 minutes of rollicking Disney adventure."
    },
    {
      "text": "Throughout it's entirety, in fact, the plot is such that you can see the grouting, you can see the screenwriting glue between the much-mulled-over ideas."
    },
    {
      "text": "The visual textures of the Frozen world remain sumptuous, from the jewel-toned forest to the foamy ocean waves that Elsa confronts in a breathtaking sequence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen II is a worthy follow-up with enough heart, action, and music to entertain younger and older viewers alike."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not a make-cash sequel but a glorious \"Part 2\" of full story of the two sisters beloved since '13 by devoted fans of all ages, places, and genders. None will be disappointed."
    },
    {
      "text": "May not take you into the unknown ... but it's a worthy-enough sequel that will ironically play strongest to older kids and adults who are spiritually equipped to handle its developing themes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anna ends up singing \"hello darkness, I'm ready to succumb\" and \"this grief has a gravity, it pulls me down.\" Like much of the rest of the film, it's a bummer."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it's interesting to see a Disney sequel borrow parts of its plot from The Fifth Element, of all things, Frozen II ultimately doesn't go anywhere we don't expect it to. Let's hope that the inevitable Part III is willing to take a few more risks."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's so much affection for and investment in the original characters...people will be excited...but I just didn't get the magic. It's fine, but Frozen I was so much more than fine..."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Some] sequences have a gleam and a rhythm to them that encapsulates Disney animation at its purest and most sinuous. The film itself doesn't hit that sweet spot that makes Pixar animations, for example, fun for adults as well as their children."
    },
    {
      "text": "This movie is so confusing that even talking about it is confusing."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a well-considered, beautifully made - if not particularly brave or adventurous - sequel which carries both emotional heft and an intriguing mystery at its heart."
    },

      "text": "Frozen II is an ambitious and challenging animated film that tries to evolve not only its own story but also the expectations for all of Disney animation."
    },
    {
      "text": "'Frozen 2' is one more Disney film this year that has taken on some huge social topics and masked them in a story that rivets audiences."
    },
    {
      "text": "Your kids will love it. But if you're like me and you love the original for its depth and how well thought out its thematic strengths were, you will find this one sorely lacking."
    },
    {
      "text": "The songs in Frozen 2 are memorable, welcoming and fresh and its fun to see the Arendelle gang all back together."
    },
    {
      "text": "An enjoyable film, though Elsa's lack of romantic plotline would be more admirable if all of her songs didn't make her sound like she was trying to come out of the closet."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even those who don't will be swept up in the propulsive narrative, the sumptuous beauty and the delight of characters who love each other no matter what."
    },

      "text": "But it's the relationship between Elsa and Anna that gets the main focus, as it should, offering the sisters another chance to forge their own paths."

    },
    {
      "text": "The original was always going to be a hard act to follow, and although it doesn't quite reach the heights, this sequel should give fans, old and new, a lot of joy."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its message of female empowerment, and soundtrack full of earworms - once again written by the award-winning couple Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez - Frozen 2 sticks to its predecessor's winning formula."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frozen 2 just lets us know what is missing and, for a film that puts a lot of weight behind the idea of its characters moving on, this one clearly knows it is not yet ready to."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ultimately, Frozen II feels like a strong continuation of the popular Disney franchise. The movie reunites some of the best parts of the first film and still manages to develop and improve on the already highly tuned stylistic imagery."
    },
    {
      "text": "Too bad Frozen 2 doesn't so much chart a new path as echo the one previously laid out."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's one thing watching the final credits roll to see the names of the voice cast, but by the time they detail all the people who worked on the film's 'Data and Pipeline Infrastructure', you'll be more than ready for the exit."
    },

      "text": "Not only is the imagery even more impressive, but the story is hugely ambitious, allowing characters to deepen in some intriguing ways."
