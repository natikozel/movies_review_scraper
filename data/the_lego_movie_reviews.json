    },
    {
      "text": "It's brilliantly animated and incredibly well shot - whether it's the dazzling 'Busytown' cityscapes that children's author-illustrator Richard Scarry might once have created or simply two characters defying the breathtakingly shallow depth of field."

    },
    {
      "text": "By going off the proverbial reservation, making what amounts to a Lego movie for adults, even at the risk of displeasing those who wanted nothing more than a nostalgic wink fest, The Lego Movie merits praise as a true work of thematic richness."

    },
    {
      "text": "Just as the conceptual agility of The LEGO Movie never ceases to astonish - it will take at least three viewings to fully take in every last detail applied here - the visuals both innovate and resonate to heights only previously scaled by Pixar."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's fast, smart, really funny, full of great action and contains a song, 'Everything is Awesome', with the single catchiest hook in the history of songwriting. Seriously, in this movie at least, everything really is awesome."
