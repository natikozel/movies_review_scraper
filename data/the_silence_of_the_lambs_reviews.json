      "text": "Does Demme's movie explore the darkness of the human psyche, or merely ride its shadowy back to the bank?"
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Liberal, conservative, gross, fastidious, sly, responsible, feminist, sex-fearing, it is a particularly American compendium of impulses, a career breakthrough for Jonathan Demme that is also a Pyrrhic victory for his politics."
    },

      "text": "It has a gutsy, intelligent heroine (a difficult role admirably played by Jodie Foster), who finds police work, a socially, useful and personally therapeutic, activity, quite a change from the current run of movie cops."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is no question that Jonathan Demme's film of Thomas Harris's best-seller is a polished production that will delight the box office. But some of the shock elements, instead of scaring you out of your skin, leave something of a nasty aftertaste."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "[It's] one of the most terrifying horror films seen in recent memory, but this isn't the result of severed heads and bloodletting. Rather, the goose bumps and queasiness are aroused by the psychological terror emanating from the twisted mind of a madman."

      "text": "Remarkably, for all its forensic detail, The Silence Of The Lambs is as much a film about a young woman's discoveries about herself as it is a \"gruesome\" thriller about tracking a serial killer."
    },
    {
      "text": "Silence Of The Lambs is being called \"the Psycho for the 90s\". It's an apt description; like Psycho, Silence will set new standards of excellence for its genre."
    },
    {
      "text": "Beyond its serial killer setup, Clarice's journey for identity, which draws from classical structures and supplies an inspired variation on them, is what makes The Silence of the Lambs so rewarding time after time."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the all-time great thrillers. Demme directs this for maximum suspense, yet the film also works as a multilayered feminist tale, with Foster's resourceful agent emerging as a beautifully conceived character."

      "text": "Impeccably directed, written and acted, The Silence of the Lambs is a classic for a reason."
    },
    {

      "text": "...the distinguishing factor is the sense of humanity Demme brings to this inhumane material."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although, in essence, it could be considered a police procedural work, Demme films it like an arty horror, always cloaking the action in an air of non-omniscience."
    },
    {
      "text": "So near perfection it practically defies criticism."
    },
    {
      "text": "It works as a horror movie, but also as a police procedural, a suspenseful thriller, and as a character study."

    {
      "text": "[Foster and Hopkins's] scenes together are, to my mind, the best in a recent Hollywood film."

      "text": "It is competent melodrama spun off from a fiendishly clever book."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although The Silence of the Lambs is of dubious moral value -- a triumph of technique rather than ideas -- it is not offensive. And as a pure thriller, it ranks with the classics."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's ultimately rather remarkable just how engrossing The Silence of the Lambs remains for the duration of its 118 minute running time..."
    },
    {
      "text": "A film far ahead of its time. Maybe even of our time as well. It feels somehow prescient, timeless, a dark portrait of humanity's very worst coupled with the hopeful idea of what we could be."
    },
    {
      "text": "The creator of Something Wild establishes a similarly unpredictable context here, mixing suspense and thrills and even black humor in provocative fashion."

      "text": "Harrowing, tense, and unforgettable..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hopkins as Lecter is chilling throughout, and he delivers one of the best final lines in movie history."
    },
    {
      "text": "Demme's use of close-ups is remarkable, and not something that's translated into contemporary film language too often anymore: Faces, eyes, hands; they're everywhere, making the suspense personal, and therefore way more frightening."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs has everything you want in a popular thriller. It's stylish, intelligent, audacious rather than shocking, and stolen by a suave monster you'll never forget."

      "text": "Nearly three decades on, The Silence of the Lambs doesn't just hold up: it still startles in finesse and execution."
    },
    {
      "text": "Are these the laws of desire in a decaying culture built on the husks of atrophied ideals, where longing is a destructive touch and relationships are made out of perverse torment?"
    },
    {
      "text": "One of Demme's great skills is his sense of balance; set pieces are alternately propelled by ratcheting tension and slow, mounting dread, while his exquisite match cuts between parallel storylines keep the pace nimble."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anthony Hopkins' performance as Lecter is an uproarious technical masterpiece."
    },
    {
      "text": "An exquisite piece of filmmaking in which basically not one single thing goes wrong at any point."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Silence of the Lambs, with its dark Freudian subtext, its Poe-like air of foreboding and its chillingly gritty characterizations, is simply a very tough and very scary little movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie, scary and graphic to cause timid souls (such as this writer) to close their eyes at certain points, has a vise-like grip on the audience."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jonathan Demme's hypnotic adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel has a seriousness and intensity that's been entirely lacking in horror movies lately."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hopkins' cumulative screen image is one of civility and decency, and the association adds to the withering, macabre effect of his murderer. It is a remarkably lucid portrait of lunacy."

    {
      "text": "The confrontations between Foster and Hopkins -- facing her from an ultrasecure cell -- are models of chilling intensity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Demme comes at Harris' material from another angle: His movie may deal with madness, but his perspective is mercifully sane."
    },
    {
      "text": "More than a disappointment, the film is an almost systematic denial of Demme's credentials as an artist and filmmaker... It's a gnarled, brutal, highly manipulative film that, at its center, seems morally indefensible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jonathan Demme's thriller is artful pulp -- tabloid material treated with intelligence and care and a weird kind of sensitivity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Has any horror movie equalled it in the past 22 years? Perhaps. But if only one super-gory flick is ever considered worthy enough for the Academy's top prize, I'm fine with this being it."
    },
    {
      "text": "This multi-Oscar-winning classic, adapted from Thomas Harris's bestseller, was responsible for giving cinematic serial killers a better image, thanks to Anthony Hopkins's enthralling portrayal of Hannibal Lecter."
    },
    {
      "text": "An exceptionally good film, perhaps this fine director's best, in which the horror genre is elevated into the kind of cinema that can at least be argued about as a treatise for its unsettling times."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hopkins' performance may be the film's bravura showpiece, but Foster's goes the whole distance, steadfast, controlled, heartbreakingly insightful, a fine addition to her gallery of characterizations."
