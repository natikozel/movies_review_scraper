    {
      "text": "I really enjoyed the film despite it being a bit overlong. Jimmy Stewart gives a very endearing and honest performance that stands the test of time."

    {
      "text": "The involvement of Jennifer Jones doesnâ€™t hurt and Joseph Cotten never looked dreamier. If you have ever been attracted to the idea of doomed, obsessive love then this might be for you."

      "text": "It's a Wonderful Life to this day stands as one of the strongest holiday features ever made."

    {
      "text": "Everything about it works and it snugly fits into the category of timeless."
    },
    {
      "text": "Capra, in fact, shrinks, as Ford and Wyler have shrunk, from pursuing the inquiry into human nature; so far as the easy superficial goodness, but no farther."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jimmy Stewart's performance is the reason we keep coming back decade after decade."
    },
    {
      "text": "Capra remained true to classical Hollywood narrative, conceived and directed here, it is true, with almost hallucinatory skill. The scenes of tenderness are capable of penetrating the armor of even the most skeptical critical mind."

      "text": "It is watched over and over by many. A Christmas tradition since 1946."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are a number of fantastic performances in the film, led by Jimmy Stewart. Stewart captures the many faces and phases of George Bailey..."

    {
      "text": "When watching It's A Wonderful Life it is easy to see that film is a legitimate art form and that Hollywood really doesn't make them like this anymore."
    },
    {
      "text": "Capra enriches his picture with sharp social satire and Dickensesque comments on human behavior. Those who are wearying of Scrooge and Bob Cratchit may find it a closer-to-home version of A Christmas Carol."

      "text": "Like a nice snifter of the Christmas brandy, it warms the heart and makes you feel good."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although it's regularly viewed as a prime example of director Capra's perspectives on the everyman and human ideals, it's a grand accomplishment in romantic comedy."

    },
    {
      "text": "One problem with the film is that it's only in the acquisition of money and the community subjugating their own savings and needs for George, that his rebirth can be complete."
    },
    {
      "text": "Paralyzing joys are the very heart of George Bailey's dilemma; they are, to borrow words from George's father, \"deep in the race.\""

    {
      "text": "While it isn't the best picture to come out of Hollywood this year, nor is it Capra's masterpiece, it tells a good story and its conclusion has a heart-warming effect on the audience."

    },
    {
      "text": "This masterpiece from Frank Capra still has a lot to say about community spirit and is a film with much more to it than feel-good sentimentality."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is the all-time great, curl-up-on-the-sofa-with-a-cup-of-tea movie. Not only is it beautifully photographed, but it also contains enough emotional strength to hold your attention for all of its two-hour running time."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a Wonderful Life is about hunger. It's about greed. It's about the many ways a good man is stymied. Finally, it's about George Bailey, whose decency prevents him even from killing himself."
    },
    {
      "text": "I wasn't able to get reasonably straight about it for quite a while. I still think it has a good deal of charm and quality, enough natural talent involved in it to make ten pictures ten times as good, and terrific vitality or, rather, vigor."
    },
    {
      "text": "Capra is an old-time movie craftsman, the master of every trick in the bag, and in many ways he is more at home with the medium than any other Hollywood director. But all of his details give the impression of contrived effect."

      "text": "This classic delivers warmth all year long."
    },

      "text": "Raise your hand if you think 'It's A Wonderful Life' is mushy, sentimental, over-praised hokum. Now, go to your room. Both of you."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you can separate - or rescue - It's a Wonderful Life from its niche as a Christmas classic, you might discover a film that swings wildly from noirlike starkness to saccharine bathos."
    },
    {
      "text": "A genuine American classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "You'd have to possess a very hard heart not to find something to love in this story."

    },
    {
      "text": "History vindicated Capra: Though failure at the time of release, the superbly acted film (terrific Jimmy Stewart) is recognized today as undisputable masterpiece; the film's message didn't fit the disillusioned mood of the country right after WWII"

    },
    {
      "text": "By now everyone knows Frank Capra's holiday classic and the tears it so effortlessly conjures up year after year -- but it's easy to forget how truly vicious the film is, and how brilliantly James Stewart rises to the challenge."

      "text": "Resistance is futile."
    },
    {
      "text": "Surprising when actually analyzed. It's mostly buildup and only the last half hour is the ghost story. But it works."
    },
    {
      "text": "As the hero, Mr. Stewart does a warmly appealing job, indicating that he has grown in spiritual stature as well as in talent during the years he was in the war. And Donna Reed is remarkably poised and gracious as his adoring sweet-heart and wife."

    {
      "text": "It suits a lot of people, but I find it hypocritical and false."
    },
    {
      "text": "This sentimental perennial is a holiday chestnut."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are hokey moments galore and the ten minutes preceding the final five are almost too corny but nothing can diminish the overall effect of this heartwarming tribute to an ordinary man."

      "text": "a truly classic, timeless film, one of the few that quite simply never grows old"
    },
    {
      "text": "The enshrinement of the greatest Twilight Zone episode never made as a yuppie icon and feel-good weepie overlooked the fact that it's one of the darkest, most self-abasing stories ever told in Hollywood."

    {
      "text": "Although sometimes bordering on the maudlin, it remains a beautifully uplifting story and a sweet little comedy as well."
    },
    {
      "text": "What is remarkable about It's a Wonderful Life is how well it holds up over the years; it's one of those ageless movies, like Casablanca or The Third Man, that improves with age."

    {
      "text": "It's A Wonderful Life (1946), originally made for Liberty Films, is one of the most popular and heartwarming films ever made by director Frank Capra. Frank Capra regarded this film as his own personal favorite - it was also James Stewart's favorite"
