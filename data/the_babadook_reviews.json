    },
    {
      "text": "Here’s a horror film that strays away from cheap thrills, and taps into something real; true human fear, grief, anxiety, and depression...the more I thought of The Babadook, the deeper it sank into my psyche."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook succeeds on nearly every level. Its supernatural scares are effectively grounded in real-life tragedy and broken relationships that are depicted brilliantly by a superb performance from Essie Davis."
    },
    {
      "text": "Essie Davis is a revelation in Jennifer Kent's meditation on grief and the challenges of single parenting. It's easy to hate Samuel, but the film is actually carefully calibrated to shift the villain status from son to mother. It all really works"

      "text": "It walks the fine line between reality and nightmares with skilled footing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Watch the film as an ironic coming-out story, or as an atmospheric creeper playing with themes of depression and mental illness. Either way, we have a feeling well be seeing The Babadook at Halloween partiesand pride celebrationsfor years to come."

    },
    {
      "text": "From early on there's something gorgeously wrong in its rhythms - a nasty arrhythmic pulse like a hiccup inside our chest or a bubble of air in our bloodstream, weaving towards our heart. It squeezes and it squeezes and oh, what a marvelous rush."

    {
      "text": "The Babadook, the debut feature from Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, has all the right elements in place for an effective horror film, but ultimately stumbles when they fail to congeal."

      "text": "Is to parenting what The Shining is to alcoholism."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Director Jennifer Kent's] ability to tap into base human fears and without the aid of cheap or excessive frills only makes this simplistic narrative all the more potent. Additionally, Kent's built her scares around a strong, emotional core."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook is impressive for its focused script, acting as a giant metaphor about either letting our demons take over of our lives or learning to keep them at bay, no matter how scary it may seem."
    },
    {
      "text": "Filled with layers of rich meaning, two spectacular performances and whizz-inducing frights, Kent's The Babadook isn't a good horror movie; it's a great film."
    },
    {
      "text": "[In 2019], it remains the best horror film so far this century."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook is our worst fear and it clings to us in hopes to suck us dry of happiness and joy and love - the Babadook wants us to turn into everything that is wrong and evil in the world."

    },
    {
      "text": "It had amazing acting, a creative storyline, and it still was able to give me the heebie jeebies. It's a horror film with a deeper meaning about how people deal with grief after the death of a loved one."
    },
    {
      "text": "Silly name; very smart movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "I cannot recall a recent horror film that so effectively utilized sound editing to jolt the hairs on the back of your neck to attention."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rich in mental metaphor, the monster knocking at the door only exists from the power we give it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Almost everything about Jennifer Kent's film is powerful: the haunting music, the sharp visual sensibility (including phenomenal use of old TV clips), the tightening tension as Amelia's isolation grows."
    },
    {
      "text": "Kent knows what she's doing - possessed parents, sinister children and haunted homes - this is the stuff sleepless nights are made of."
    },

      "text": "Jagged thrusts of dark humour pepper the scary stuff and will appeal to any less-than-perfect mother who has 'lost it' in the heat of the moment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its portrait of maternal exhaustion is intense and disturbing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nestled deep within this teeny Australian thriller packs a simple yet profound message about what it often feels like to be a single parent, and even what it feels like to be the child of that parent."
    },
    {
      "text": "The filmmaker understands that things barely glimpsed are infinitely more terrifying than the monster in full view."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook is very rich, and while it pulls on a number of other resources, it delivers its own unique aesthetic and storyline."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's become increasingly rare for horror films to make an effort to truly scare us these days, but Jennifer Kent's 'The Babadook' gets under the skin in ways that are both visceral and highly emotional."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook's villains and victims are still running amok in my brain. I think they might be there for some time."

    },
    {
      "text": "For her first feature, Australian actress-turned-filmmaker Jennifer Kent creates a startlingly effective horror movie by combining serious scariness with some darkly evocative emotion."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are legitimate terrors here -- legitimate because, as any bleary-eyed parent will verify, they come from a real and terrible place. And for those who do enjoy at least some defiance of natural laws, The Babadook has that too."
    },
    {
      "text": "What's most terrifying about The Babadook is that Kent grounds a bizarre supernatural premise in very real feelings of anxiety and depression."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's as likely to thrill more casual horror audiences as it is to satisfy long-time aficionados of the genre. Given the time of year, I couldn't recommend it more."
    },
    {
      "text": "Where the film truly excels though is in its sound design. The Babadook is truly a film to see in a well equipped cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rest assured, Jennifer Kent's debut more than lives up to the hype."
    },
    {
      "text": "I can't think of a movie since Rosemary's Baby which acknowledges the unspoken fears of motherhood with such humor, horror, and compassion."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's amazing what Kent manages to squeeze out of some of the most worn horror tropes in the book (in this case the literal book)."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an incredibly well made horror film, and Kent is superb at getting under the audience's skin."
    },
    {
      "text": "For all its otherworldly flourishes, it confirms that the most terrifying monsters are remarkably local -- domestic, even."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook is the best horror movie I've seen in some time, because it works on all those emotional and psychological levels in addition to succeeding as a straight genre outing."
    },
    {
      "text": "It would be easy to call this a thinking person's horror film, but that would be to deny its many deliciously visceral moments of flesh-crawling terror."
    },
    {
      "text": "Davis gives one of the best performances you will see this, or in any other, year."
    },
    {
      "text": "Writer/director Jennifer Kent has crafted a masterfully scary movie that relies on sound design and a claustrophobic atmosphere to build tension to nearly unbearable heights."
    },
    {
      "text": "The style of the film is not teasing exactly -- it's too sad and lonely -- but there is certainly a hair-pulling mixture of glum laughter and vast apprehension. Is the demon real? Does it matter?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook and his escalating presence in this exacerbated single-parent family are very scary indeed, however metaphorical they may be."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an intriguing and welcome change from the hellish Hollywood formulas. Where was this Down-Under boogeyman a month ago, when we needed him, for Halloween?"
    },
    {
      "text": "While it's not exactly fun, it's deeply meaningful, which I guess is the whole point of art anyways(?)."

    },
    {
      "text": "Jennifer Kent's debut is an assured chiller that successfully piles on the dread, thanks to great casting and the creepy-as-all-hell character of the title."
    },
    {
      "text": "A deftly inventive and psychologically charged horror story that trades on the ways in which the prospect of maternal failure can be just as fearsome a boogeyman as any monster under the bed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cheap scares are refreshingly absent... It turns out they're not needed when you can drop temperatures effectively by way of precision ratchet clicks in tension, excellent sound design and chilling allegorical nods to the monsters within."

      "text": "A considerate, weird, lingering psychological horror, The Babadook is a must-watch this Halloween."

    {
      "text": "The Babadook is a worthy addition to the psycho-horror genre."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jennifer Kent's feature is beautifully made and cleverly filmed and paced. It's one of the most satisfying horror films I've seen in a while, and ends on a refreshingly original note."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook is as accessible as any number of less accomplished ghost stories -- and more genuinely unsettling for its portrait of parent and child locked in mutual but potentially conquerable hell."
    },
    {
      "text": "The proceeding thrills are economically constructed but extremely effective."
    },
    {
      "text": "Kent is tapping into something far more unnerving than serial killers or the supernatural: the everyday terror of being a parent."
    },
    {
      "text": "This isn't to say it's only about how disturbing it can be to be a mom; it's also not only about how difficult it can be to be a mom to a child who reminds you each day of your most dire trauma... The film is also about institutions that fail to serve."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rarely outside of drama do we see the kind of imperfect motherhood shown in The Babadook, which is what makes this Repulsion-like household of horrors so frightening."
    },
    {
      "text": "Come for the dread, stay for the subtext, and top it all off with a little nightlight shopping on Amazon."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook, one of the best and most original horror films in years, raises goosebumps with old-fashioned scares, relatable characters, and a provocative psychological foundation."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film has a solid grasp on the mutable, but ever-present pain of loss."
    },
    {
      "text": "Strikingly evoking a sense of dread in the most every-day and well-lit places, Kent's accomplished effort is built around Davis' tremendous turn."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Writer/director Jennifer Kent] skillfully keeps us locked into the moment-by-moment thrills of a monster movie, but also insists that this Babadook is clearly a stand-in for the other problems that inflict the lonely household."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook lures you in with the familiar childhood fears about something lurking under your bed but delivers something fresh and even surprising."
    },
    {
      "text": "Full of great little touches that add up to a whole lot, and a wonderful reminder that one need not re-invent the wheel to create a quality horror movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook doesn't just introduce a new horror classic to audiences. It also marks the assured feature debut of Jennifer Kent."
    },
    {
      "text": "It won't rewrite the book on horror movies, but it offers a fun chapter."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook descends to the truly horrific when you begin to see it as the literary manifestation of insomniac's murder fantasy."
    },
    {
      "text": "A stirring little piece of psychological drama in which all the optimism and joyful human interactions have been stripped away, leaving behind only the negative extremes."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you are brave enough to watch this low-budget gem from Australia, then you'll know it's a \"special kind\" of scary."
    },
    {
      "text": "Making a significant feature-film debut as both director and writer, Jennifer Kent has fashioned a psychological drama that's ultimately more about real-world terrors than about the types of monsters that reside in the closet or under the bed."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook will trap you in its pages with its compelling performances. but like every kid's book, your happy ending is waiting for you on the last page."
    },
    {
      "text": "Writer-director Jennifer Kent eschews most horror conventions in favour of wholly original visuals and resonant human drama, abetted by a very powerful performance by Davis."
    },
    {
      "text": "The line between terrifying reality and terrifying fantasy isn't so much blurred as altogether obliterated."
    },
    {
      "text": "This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times."
    },
    {
      "text": "It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you go to see The Babadook, be sure to have your wits about you. This movie will scare you out of them."
    },

      "text": "At its heart, \"The Babadook\" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying."
    },
    {
      "text": "When the film turns horrifying, The Babadook deftly negotiates the thin line between a well-handled metaphor and a hamfisted one and never strays from the right side of it."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane."
    },
    {
      "text": "As someone who has developed a pretty thick Critic's Shield from years of watching standard haunted house/possessed human/mythological-creature fare, I have to say I was genuinely freaked out by some of the passages in The Badabook."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tthrowback horror picture that grips us with pounding in the night, startling effects such as the appearance of roaches and pools of black blood, and lightning-flash manifestations of the supernatural."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's incredibly chilling, but the horror doesn't take away from the raw emotion of a mother struggling against herself and stuck between connecting with her child or hurting him."
    },
    {
      "text": "The direction is plain and demonstrative, emphasising the isolation and confinement of the characters in a world (and specifically a home) that seems to have turned against them."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook is a stunning feature film debut for writer-director Jennifer Kent, who lends humanity to the genre without sacrificing the creep factor."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a movie that uses dread and suspense, not cheap jump scares. It's also a movie that unsettles with deep psychological unpleasantness. And it's got a pretty killer title, as well."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Australian thriller The Babadook is one of the most terrifying horror movies this year, because it roots its shocks in the most primal of emotions: mother love."
    },
    {
      "text": "Boasting brilliant performances from the two leads, it will be the cause of many a nightmare."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook is easily the best horror film of 2014. But bolstered by knockout performances, and a mind-bending narrative beautifully shot and colored, The Babadook is so much more. It's one of the best films of the year."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook frightens because it feels true."
    },
    {
      "text": "A haunting masterpiece of psychological horror, claustrophobia and paranoia in the vein of Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and The Tenant, Stanley Kubrick's The Shining and William Friedkin's The Exorcist."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Babadook makes a convincing argument for classy, psychological horror cinema even as it fails to meet its own lofty standard."
    },
    {
      "text": "Few male directors could've conveyed Amelia's wretched state without making her seem hideous or shown Sam's deep anger without making him unlikable. Kent has done both and left us to decide exactly what we think about this troubled [relationship]."

    },
    {

      "text": "Jennifer Kent's tremendously atmospheric and creepy horror comes highly recommended for those who like complex characterisation and ambiguity with their thrills and chills."
    },
    {
      "text": "The imminence of both half-term and Halloween certainly makes for a varied batch of releases, with The Babadook firmly at the scary end of the spectrum. It is properly chilling."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's very personal, and it plays on the very real fears and anxieties of parenthood in a way that never feels \"cool,\" but that always feels authentic."
    },
    {
      "text": "A supernatural fairy tale with real humanity, The Babadook is a resounding success. If you hear him knocking, be sure to let Mister Babadook in."

      "text": "The Babadook doesn't just tower over this year's other fright films: It's one of the most emotionally affecting pieces of macabre cinema in years."
    },

      "text": "Finally, a good horror movie with scary thrills, but also ambiguity and psychological subtext"
    },
    {
      "text": "This Australian thriller is refreshing because it smartly generates its chills from true psychological horrors rather than jump scares or technical gimmicks."

      "text": "The Babadook, for all its primal borrowing from other movies, is first and foremost a Jennifer Kent film, and it's great. She's burned her influences, and the result is indelible, and toxic and scalding and scarifying and terrific to the touch."
