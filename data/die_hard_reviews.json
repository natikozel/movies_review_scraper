    {
      "text": "One of the most divisive holiday classics, the argument on whether John McTiernan's Die Hard is a Christmas movie, finds its way to the forefront every year. For myself, the truth is indisputable. Die Hard is a Christmas film - no, a Christmas classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "To say Die Hard still holds up is an understatement: charismatic protagonist and antagonist, great action set pieces, well paced and a top class finale. It’s no wonder so many other films and TV series continue to “do a Die Hard”, it’s still hard to top."
    },
    {
      "text": "Top to bottom, it is just endlessly entertaining and well-crafted with outstanding work from all involved. No matter how much action movies have continued to grow, this will always be the cinematic elder statesman that can scrap with the best of them."
    },
    {
      "text": "That’s right, I’m saying it, loudly and proudly, since John McTiernan’s 1988 action classic isn’t just set at Christmastime—it embodies the very spirit of the holiday."
    },
    {
      "text": "The gold standard for action filmmaking; what action movie tropes Die Hard doesn't follow, it reinvents or altogether originates, and all of them have yet to be bettered."

    {
      "text": "Sometimes-more often than not, even- a script with many hands on it becomes a case of too many cooks. With Die Hard, competing experienced creatives produced a film that works on multiple levels."
    },
    {
      "text": "Still the prototype of the modern action yarn -- its status was secured so rapidly that subsequent action romps were invariably described as \"Die Hard on a train / plane / bus / zeppelin / tricycle / what-have-you.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "Die Hard is not only an excellent action film, it is an excellent film overall and its ability to stand the test of time and still hold up is admirable."
    },
    {
      "text": "A spectacularly thrilling film, possessing enough brains to match its brawn."
    },
    {
      "text": "The picture is extremely violent: bombs go off, bullets rip through flesh, heads are slammed against steel. But Die Hard is also smart, satirical-and, in an odd way, heartwarming."

    },
    {
      "text": "Die Hard is a great example of the Hollywood studio system getting moviemaking right - the film is a perfect storm of story and talent coming together."

    {
      "text": "Die Hard still feels as fresh and thrilling as the first time it screened."
    },
    {
      "text": "From the superb pacing through to the sarcastically sinister villainy of Alan Rickman, this remains a crucial template for the modern action film."
    },

      "text": "It's as though the filmmakers approached each scene by asking themselves how entertaining they could make it."

    },
    {
      "text": "Die Hard is film's equivalent of a terrorist attack on your senses, but Willis' intensity and presence push it into guilty pleasure territory."
    },
    {
      "text": "What sets 'Die Hard' apart from most action movies is the depth of characterization. [Detective John] McClane is not a macho toy with a bullet-proof body. He is a thinking, feeling man who can't believe he's doing most of what he does."

    {
      "text": "Yippee-ki-yay, action fans."
    },
    {
      "text": "For all its moments of almost overwhelming cheese, Die Hard is still the definitive action thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "Within the narrow framework of the hard-action genre, Die Hard is almost as good as it gets."
    },
    {
      "text": "Willis gleefully strips down the action movie to a pretend game for children who like to fire guns and shoot bad guys. Machismo may never be the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "Die Hard is probably the most manipulative movie I've seen this year, but since it makes no bones about being manipulative and does it so well, this not only isn't a problem -- it's fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "Die Hard is an action picture with a capital A. In fact, you might as well go ahead and capitalize the whole darn word."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a grand flourish of cinematic technique, it is awesome; as a human drama, it is disgusting and silly, a mindless depiction of carnage on an epic scale."
    },
    {
      "text": "The very pinnacle of the '80s action movie, and if it's not the greatest action movie ever made, then it's damn close."
    },
    {
      "text": "Most of the action is run-of-the-mill Hollywood blood and thunder, but a couple of scenes are unusually reprehensible."
    },
    {
      "text": "McTiernan, who directed last summer's Predator, composes the action cleanly and logically, making good use of Jackson DeGovia's elaborate post-modernist set-the building becomes something of a character in itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "DIE HARD is a classic film. Simply put, every single thing works."

      "text": "... Not only the best action movie ever made but one of the very best of any genre."

      "text": "High-tech cartoonish action thriller."

    {
      "text": "In the first half of Director John McTiernan's movie, Willis wears an undershirt. In the second half he gets rid of it. And that's pretty much it for his performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Die Hard is as high tech, rock hard and souped up as an action film can be."

    {
      "text": "A serviceable if rather overextended and overblown adventure thriller."

    },
    {
      "text": "A seminal action film that created an entire subgenre. Super action, but the key to its success is how it effectively pits Willis' common-man hero against Rickman's haughty arch-villain."
    },
    {
      "text": "A hi-tech thriller with a human heart."

    {
      "text": "An ingenious and ceaselessly self-renewing thriller that surpasses every seeming limitation."
    },
    {
      "text": "Marks the peak of the 1980's action boom that made mega-stars out of the likes of Ah-nuld, Stallone and Van Damme."

      "text": "For an evening of edge-of-your-seat entertainment, you’d be hard pressed to do much better."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may seem, in measure, that watching this in lieu of Frosty or Rudolph violates a practice during a holiday known and based on custom. However true, there is a discernable heart in Die Hard."

      "text": "...practically reinvented the action thriller, or at least resuscitated a moribund genre."
