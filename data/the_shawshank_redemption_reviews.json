      "text": "... a faith-based movie without any faith."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont cut right to the heart of a flock of human birds trapped in a giant cage, under the watch of a corrupt warden and terrifyingly sinister guard. It was serious, certain, and made you laugh. Freeman's legend has never shined brighter."
    },
    {
      "text": "If this is a feel-good movie -- and by the end it certainly is -- then at least it challenges us to dig deep for those good feelings when everything inside those mausoleum walls is unrelievedly harsh and grey."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is both resigned and inspirational, grittily realistic and vaguely surreal, matter-of-fact and operatic. Somehow, these opposites are combined into a remarkably smooth and lyrical composition."
    },
    {
      "text": "The sad thing is that The Shawshank Redemption, a so-so film, would have made a terrific little movie. A pacier project would have given us less time to notice sentimentalities."
    },
    {
      "text": "Next to Stand By Me, The Shawshank Redemption ranks as the strongest, purest film ever made from a novel or novella by Stephen King, a monster film where the horrors are frighteningly human."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's Robbins and Freeman who carry the film, working around the most predictable moments with simple understatement."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's nothing going on in The Shawshank Redemption from shot to shot -- no expressive life, no spontaneity or feeling. It's a stunted movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "The acting is so strong, so seductive in The Shawshank Redemption that you almost don't notice this epic prison drama isn't all that good."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont, making his debut as a director, is swamped by ambition. There is just too much here -- too much plot, too many particulars, too many prisoners vying for attention."
    },
    {
      "text": "A hackneyed prison movie with acting so strong that it often seems more substantive than it is."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption may be working with stuff we've seen before, but it's surprisingly strong and engrossing. Even elitists in the audience who dismiss King as a shock schlockmeister may be amazed at this picture's narrative grip."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its message of hope and friendship comes premixed with a sizable dollop of unappetizing violence, intended to convince audiences that what they're watching isn't a big glob of cotton candy after all."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont gets Robbins' most subtle and multi-layered performance to date. But the Oscar nomination will go to Freeman, who shows the majesty of sadness and how sweet redemption can be -- even when all hope is lost."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a movie with dignity and surprises and before it has finished, it has acquired a good deal of power."
    },
    {
      "text": "The towering Tim Robbins has a solidity and gentle interiority that occasionally reminds one here of Burt Lancaster. Of equal excellence is Morgan Freeman as Red, who holds the film together with his poetic, often quipping narration."
    },
    {
      "text": "You've never seen a prison movie quite like it, and I found its eccentric rhythms and the performances of co-stars Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman nearly irresistible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even the most prosecutorial viewer will concede that Robbins and Freeman give The Shawshank Redemption a persuasive validity. They hold The Shawshank Redemption together as it gives way to story-driven melodrama."
    },
    {
      "text": "A work of sincerity and honorable purpose, with a first-class cast... [But] Darabont has not found a way to resolve the problems and improbabilities that tower higher than the walls of the maximum security prison."
    },
    {
      "text": "Never will you be so glad of the voyeuristic nature of filmgoing. Because The Shawshank Redemption is as close to prison as you'll want to get. And Robbins and Freeman make what could have been an endurance test an utterly engrossing experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a blissfully old-fashioned melodrama spanning three decades, a classic tall tale that experiences some particularly incredible growth spurts toward the end but manages to endure them without alienating the viewer."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's way too long, blatantly manipulative, and sentimental to a fault. Still, the lead performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are heartfelt, impressively shaded pieces of work (Freeman in particular is a marvel)."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is ultimately about the blossoming of the spirit in the muddiest of grounds. It isn't pretty. It is long. But it's very powerful."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont's screenplay is too expertly massaged for its own good, but the performances, particularly Freeman's authoritative portrayal, redeem much of the formula."
    },
    {
      "text": "This dude-bro fave is neither the best Stephen King screen adaptation (there’s Carrie, for one) nor the best movie of its year (at least 20 were superior). Nevertheless, there’s much to enjoy in this period prison flick."
    },
    {
      "text": "Exhibiting the unwavering assurance of a seasoned veteran at the top of his form, Darabont transcends all the clichés, giving us a film about prison that is ineffably sad, achingly sweet and -- yes -- even life affirming."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robbins and Freeman are a wonderful polar pairing; young and old, white and black, minimalist and expressionist actors. Watching Andy and Red's wary friendship blossom through these performers is the best aspect of Darabont's film."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is a quality of authenticity about The Shawshank Redemption that makes it irrelevant whether one enjoys the film as plain entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "If The Shawshank Redemption, adapted from a Stephen King novella, is familiar, it earns respect by configuring these familiar elements in an engaging, shrewdly constructed way."
    },
    {
      "text": "Freeman and Robbins have done wonders, giving Red and Andy nuances that render them memorable, even in the context of a forgettable and formulaic film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont has crafted an intelligent, perceptive picture. But at nearly 2.5 hours, it's an emotional endurance match, blanketing the audience with oppressive mood under which prisoners live until you feel the weight and drag of their empty days."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is a movie that lives or dies on the capabilities of its stars. And they are eminently capable."
    },
    {
      "text": "From beginning to end, Robbins and Freeman command the film. Their performances are equally astonishing. But it's Darabont who gets most of the credit for turning a small story into a profoundly moving epic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frank Darabont has found some wonderful ways of updating clichés. Plus, there's unique sweetness in Andy and Red's relationship and these two seasoned pros savor every nuance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tim Robbins delivers a distinguished performance, with Morgan Freeman equally marvelous. This is that rare movie occurrence that has the ability to sweep the viewer into an alien universe; it is superior filmmaking on any level."
    },
    {
      "text": "For a film about deceit, The Shawshank Redemption offers a smart con-trick in its own plotting: one I must not reveal, however, except to say its total improbability is pardonable because its surprise is morally exhilarating."
    },
    {
      "text": "Who woulda thought Stephen King could be poetic? Yet in The Shawshank Redemption, a film based on his short novel, he's positively Steinbeckian."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont digs into the meat of the story, coming out with a film that should surprise anyone convinced that all King ever knew how to do was simply scare people."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Shawshank,\" like precious few films in the genre, brings a dignity, strength and compassion that has become all too rare on the screen these days."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you can get past patchy character development and lefty underpinnings about criminal justice, The Shawshank Redemption stands as an uplifting story of enduring hope."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's easy to admire what this film says about the human spirit and its needs, but difficult to appreciate how obvious it is in its manipulation of us."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is a typical buddy movie and a superior prison film; the acting is flawless, the story engrossing and the direction assured."
    },
    {
      "text": "However, if you can look past the uneven character development and criminal justice underpinnings, The Shawshank Redemption is a story of enduring hope forged by an indomitable spirit and the bonds of rock-solid friendship. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is affecting and entertaining, solely because first-time director Frank Darabont... lets his actors do the talking, and they play this piece at precisely the right pitch."
    },
    {
      "text": "An old-fashioned yarn that takes all the standard conventions of the \"big-house\" drama and makes them seem fresh and original."
    },
    {
      "text": "Part character study, part survival drama and part con game, The Shawshank Redemption is all absorbing and compelling."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anyone who buys the denouement would surely believe almost anything."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is the best prison movie since Papillon. And the best Stephen King adaptation since Stand By Me."
    },
    {
      "text": "Larger than life, The Shawshank Redemption might at times get close to cliché for those with astringent tastes but it comes together brilliantly as an expansive and heartfelt hymn to the old-fashioned virtues of patience and rat-cunning."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film feels tremendously outdated and unrealistic. Simplistic, almost embarrassingly so."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is an engaging and compulsively watchable mystery story that is both frightening and funny. There is sentiment in \"Shawshank,\" but there is very little sentimentality."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is an intelligent treat for adults, not in the least because it takes that done-to-death theme -- unlikely friendship between prison inmates -- and delivers a richly textured, deeply personal moral fable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robbins and Freeman are so comfortable together you believe in their relationship, which is essential for staying with the film. Andy and Red might not in reality have hit it off so handily, but these actors are assured enough to overcome the stretch."
    },
    {
      "text": "Both a classic prison film and a superior movie. The acting is flawless, the script engrossing and the direction strong."
    },
    {
      "text": "The main acting honours go to Morgan Freeman as the wily old inmate fixer who takes Robbins under his wing. It is testimony to the film's affecting freshness that he makes a character we have seen a hundred times before seem like an entirely new creation."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont knew what he wanted -- and he appears to have gotten it. The film offers rich, dark images to match its vivid emotions. And every character is memorably delineated."
    },
    {
      "text": "You emerge from your incarceration in Shawshank Prison exhausted, incredulous at some of the plot twists, but still cheered by Robbins and Freeman's performances."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is Morgan Freeman, as the narrator Red, who carries the film. Can another Oscar nomination be in the works?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Tim Robbins, William Sadler, Bob Gunton, Clancy Brown and James Whitmore find ways to surprise us in familiar parts. Yet Freeman tower over them as Red."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption has a clever plot, conveyed through a well-crafted screenplay that loses momentum only when twists and turns stretch it... What gives the picture most of its zest and poignancy, however, is the excellence of its lead performances."
    },
    {
      "text": "You have to suspend some belief to enjoy yourself, but the ride we take has some kicks, some perversely wild humor and some intimidating moments of suspense."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tough, uplifting and gratifying, The Shawshank Redemption is a big film with heart and soul to match a prison film that understands about the freedom the human spirit is capable of achieving."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is a fine example of cinematic storytelling, and it's highly satisfying in the way it fulfils traditional expectations while providing plausible surprises."
    },
    {
      "text": "It flows smoothly from beginning to end, dawdling in places to give flavor to the prison and strength to its characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "A beloved, incessantly revisited, stone-cold classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Unmarketable upon box office release, Darabount's masterpiece tanked and seemed destined to obscurity. Only after the video release, did 'Shawshawk' reap the praise it so richly deserved. Is it one of the greatest films ever made? Without a doubt, yes."
    },
    {
      "text": "The entire cast of this movie is terrific with Robbins and Freeman leading the way."
    },
    {
      "text": "It doesn't matter how we think we remember the moments, how they look now, in this edition, will force a shift in memory that we'll most likely be grateful for."
    },
    {
      "text": "A masterclass in pretty much every category. An incredible script, wonderful direction, gorgeous score and phenomenal performances by Freeman and Robbins. Cinema doesn't get any better than this. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },

      "text": "The film has a wonderfully structured script."
    },
    {
      "text": "A magnificently hopeful, inspiring work of art."

    {
      "text": "Creates a stellar vision that teaches, challenges, inspires, and evokes a wide array of emotions and thoughts."
    },
    {
      "text": "Masterfully written and directed by Frank Darabont, Shawshank well deserves its adoration."
    },
    {
      "text": "And the final scene? I'm not crying, you're crying."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cinematic alchemy of a kind that's all too rare, propelled by a supremely talented cast, a sumptuous score by Thomas Newman and a first-rate script and direction from first-timer Frank Darabont."
    },
    {
      "text": "A tough, complex story [told] with clarity, compassion and considerable dramatic force."
    },
    {
      "text": "The problem with the film's fablistic flooziness is that it also asks for investment in the harsh realities of its prison arena to buy the later Andy and Red push for freedom."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the best out of the 1990s, and a towering force of dramatic power amongst films of its kind."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has the novelty to use plot development rather than unnecessary shock treatments to move forward."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature."
    },
    {
      "text": "Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is simply marvelous entertainment that breathes life into a genre that I thought had been dead for a decade -- the prison picture."
    },
    {
      "text": "Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing. The movie needs the kind of authenticity that Freeman brings to it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you're beyond redemption."
    },
    {
      "text": "Spiritually moving old-fashioned prison pic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The story is slow to develop, and younger kids and children sensitive to the suffering of others may find this world a difficult one to sit with for the film's duration. Having said all that, the film is satisfying but cloying."
    },
    {
      "text": "I love this film. It's a story about hope and dreams and one whose emotional impact is as great as the Pacific Ocean is blue."
    },
    {
      "text": "In a way, The Shawshank Redemption is itself a testament to overcoming odds. It is sentimental and stereotyped, yet we are able not only to suspend our disbelief but to root for it all the way."
    },
    {
      "text": "...has certainly earned its reputation as one of the most effective prison movies in cinematic history..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an old-school melodrama at heart, sturdy and forthright and upstanding, but without a whisper of complexity or wit."
    },
    {
      "text": "A testament to the human spirit, the film is a rough diamond. Its languors are small quibbles in an otherwise estimable and haunting entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film benefits greatly from elegant cinematography by Roger Deakins and a poignant score by Thomas Newman. Freeman creates an endearing portrait... and Tim Robbins gives what may be his most accomplished portrayal."
    },
    {
      "text": "A passing reference to The Count of Monte Cristo offers a partial clue to what makes this movie compelling... The film’s 19th-century storytelling mode shows how lives, personalities, and personal agendas develop over years."
    },
    {
      "text": "I have not read Stephen King's novella (his first non-horror), but some of the movie's deficiencies, such as the old-fashioned morality tale and portentous message about camaraderie and redemption -- must have been in the source material."
    },
    {
      "text": "The kind of inspiring tale that we love the movies for in the first place."
    },
    {
      "text": "A throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make."
    },
    {
      "text": "An amazing movie. Easily one of the best movies made during the 90s and definitely one of the top 'prison' movies of all-time. Pretty much everything about this movie works and works extremely well!"

      "text": "Why are these men in jail?"

    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption works not only as an excellent prison drama, but as a metaphor for overcoming our own private prisons."
    },
    {
      "text": "A film with neither nuance nor irony, a film shot in brilliant colour but cast in black and white."

      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption is one of those films that is a true work of both art and magic."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the few movies that has come out in my lifetime that I consider a \"classic film\"."
    },
    {
      "text": "Beaches for straight men."
    },
    {
      "text": "Darabont plays several Capra-like cards and gives the movie a spiritual heft rather than a suspenseful one."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a simple story elegantly, cleverly told, not to mention expertly acted."
    },
    {
      "text": "Freeman, in particular, is exceptional. His performance is so unshowy it can easily go unnoticed, but it's the soul of Shawshank."
    },
    {
      "text": "Flawlessly acted and directed, this film packed the strongest emotional wallop out of any film [in 1994]."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shawshank Redemption continually abandons plausibility in order to celebrate the triumph of hope over despair, of decency over cruelty, of justice over injustice."
    },
    {
      "text": "Without a single riot scene or horrific effect, it tells a slow, gentle story of camaraderie and growth, with an ending that abruptly finds poetic justice in what has come before."

      "text": "Thank goodness this has become a classic!"
    },
    {
      "text": "It's good, but not nearly so good as it thinks."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the late 90s best -- and most popular -- films, this tale of enduring hope can be enjoyed in repeated viewings. Beautifully scripted, superbly shot, and sumptuously scored. Morgan Freeman's words (as narrator) will stay with you forever."
    },
    {
      "text": "By blanketing the prison experience with a sepia-tone haze of nostalgia and placing it in a time that's part history, part Normal Rockwell, the film provides a trip through the belly of the beast that isn't too icky..."

      "text": "Powerful drama that reminds us that hope is a precious and buoyant emotion that can give our lives substance and meaning."

      "text": "Despite occasional lapses into familiar formulas and stereotypes, this is a first-rate prison drama"
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "It’s the no-bull performances that hold back the flood of banalities. Robbins and Freeman connect with the bruised souls of Andy and Red to create something undeniably powerful and moving."

      "text": "One of the greatest films ever committed to celluloid."

      "text": "Thanks to fine performances and beautiful photography, you get that inspirational jump-start frame after frame."
    },
    {
      "text": "Prison pictures are an overly familiar genre. But at their best they are remarkable character studies. The Shawshank Redemption manages to climb into this rank by keeping the story off-center and the twists highly entertaining in unexpected ways."

    {
      "text": "When the film's conclusion starts to unfold, you suddenly realize that this is one of the more inspiring films you've seen in a long time - yet you don't feel the least bit manipulated."

      "text": "This is a film with excellent production values almost without exception."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption."
