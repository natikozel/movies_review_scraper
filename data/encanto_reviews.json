      "text": "To cap it all off, the story by Jared Bush, Bryon Howard, and Charise Castro Smith focuses on empathy perfectly. It’s a wonderful watch for the whole family."
    },
    {
      "text": "What makes this particular instalment of Disney dream-weaving a little bit different is texture. Pulling from a colourful Central American tradition that features brilliant cotton and woollen embroidery, we can almost feel the threads of every garment..."
    },
    {
      "text": "By exploring the traditional and non-traditional nature of family, their most common modern go-to theme, they keep connected to their familiar and beloved roots while taking audiences on unfamiliar journeys."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is in its overall focus that Encanto grasps at richer themes about how the family's magic is only part of what defines them."
    },
    {
      "text": "Absolutely a must if you’re into this sort of thing, and it’s a very easy, engaging sit even if you aren’t."
    },
    {
      "text": "The screenplay has dark undertones, as all good magic realism does, but this is rooted in the troubled social history of Columbia."

    },
    {
      "text": "\"A spirit of communal celebration persists even after a first-act ceremony takes a turn for the ominous, and fleeting moments of chisme between cousins provide the movies breakneck pacing with instantly relatable doses of Latino-family bonding.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "Surface Pressure unlocked the movie for me and made it more compelling than what I thought it would be - the inevitable discovery of Mirabel's gift... it's a discovery borne out of a family's denial."
    },
    {
      "text": "Disney deserves some credit for abandoning its typical formula with Encanto. You wont see a princess sing songs about personal actualization. The film celebrates community and doesnt even have a villain."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bright, lively, and touching, Disney’s Encanto offers heaps of musical fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "That candle doesnt just provide magic to the family...It also has enough to fuel this movie to become absolutely magical."

      "text": "Encanto isnt anything you havent seen before, but it succeeds in its gratifying execution."
    },
    {
      "text": "Feisty, funny, vulnerable and brave, Mirabel is a terrific Disney heroine, and her adventures will remind animation fans of Moana and Braves Merida, and she is just as likeable and enjoyable to watch as they both are."
    },

      "text": "Come for the culture and songs, but stay for everything else."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its Lin Manuel Miranda songs topping the music chartseveryone is dancing to Brunothe time is now to see this burst of animated family enchantment.  Miranda gives this Oscar favorite a heart that sings and a spirit that soars."
    },
    {
      "text": "This pseudo fairy tale doesn't adhere to the rules of true fairy tales: such as there must be evil, which must be overcome, and there's no gaining something for nothing. Such subtle moral rudderlessness isn't maybe the best use of small children's time."
    },
    {
      "text": "The dazzling craftsmanship on display in every aspect of the film...makes Encanto a feel-good hit that delivers a hefty emotional wallop when you least expect it."

      "text": "A beautiful story of family and community, letting go of societal and familial pressures, and just being yourself. Simple in the most pure and meaningful way."
    },
    {
      "text": "With a vibrant score suggesting hidden dangers which never materialize, the final cut feels undercut. It's as if a more exciting story was muted to make room for too much of the family ensemble until it's all that remained..."

      "text": "To some degree, characters in these stories are empowered by overcoming trauma. But you could also see the trauma as creating or inspiring the empowerment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto is thoroughly enjoyable, witty and intelligent, robust in its multigenerational appeal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like the Madrigals, we're each trying to deal with all this alone - and realizing, perhaps through projects like Encanto, that maybe we don't have to."
    },
    {
      "text": "Honors Latinx families... The film doesn't portray our big, multigenerational, multiracial families as perfect or idealized. Rather, it asks us to be better."
    },
    {
      "text": "With their 60th animated feature, Disney takes us on a vibrant and magical trip to Colombia in Encanto to provide fun that the whole family can enjoy."
    },
    {
      "text": "[It] would appear to be an ideal follow-up to the studio's megahit girl-power production Frozen. This endearing, digitally animated feature actually owes more to an earlier superpowered family fantasy, The Incredibles."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's a shame that [the film] is occasionally overpowered by kitsch near the end, but it doesn't change the fundamentally positive state of mind that one takes away from Encanto. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto isn't anything particularly special when it comes to the music. However, the plot and how it handles being treated like an outsider by your own family is going to hit some people much harder than others."
    },
    {
      "text": "Directed by Jared Bush and Bryan Howard, Encanto sends all the right messages and does so with color and song."
    },

      "text": "With amazing visuals, a stellar story, and a great soundtrack, Encanto is one of the best animated films Disney has recently put out."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is a strong element of \"Beauty and the Beast (1991)\" in \"Encanto\" with its magical house in danger of being destroyed - remember Beast was in danger of dying and his magic castle disappearing."
    },
    {
      "text": "A deluge of clever, brightly coloured images and bouncy songs."
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto is a sweet and culturally thoughtful animated adventure...Its focus on family dynamics - positive and not-so-positive alike - give it a sense of universality to which most audiences will relate."

      "text": "The studio's best proposition in more than five years. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Colorful settings, catchy songs, and a gallery of secondary characters that surround the protagonist... make the film a seemly topic. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Provides a plethora of movement, bold colors... catchy songs and musical numbers that in many cases had the contribution of the prolific Lin-Manuel Miranda, who seems to be a part of any project that addresses a Latin theme. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Right away, there are too many human characters here and not enough jokes. But in most departments -- even including Lin-Michael Miranda's earnest songs -- the craft is at the level expected from a no-expense-spared Disney production."
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto feels like a smaller, more intimate story for Disney. Don't expect it to be the grand epic like Frozen, Raya and the Last Dragon or Beauty and the Beast."
    },
    {
      "text": "A quirky, beautifully animated film that's a terrific vehicle for not only expressing heritage-specific customs, but also opening doors to a new world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto certainly stands out among the recent crop of Disney Animation Studios' work."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a modest, mostly charming diversion that embraces compassion, community, and yes -- a little bit of enchantment."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the end, I think the many positives of this movie outweigh its lack of focus."
    },

      "text": "The images' exuberance of the, the characters' colors and vitality bestows an almost irresistible visual framework. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto's absolute perfection and (magical) hyper-realism leaves us speechless,... with something apparently as insignificant as the movement of a skirt. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The animation is strong and if there was an Academy Award for best animated hair, Encanto would win it. But it's too busy, its storyline too aimless, to satisfy anyone for long."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nice to look at in places, witty where it has to be, but Encanto feels a bit cobbled together."

      "text": "Fun and enjoyment for all ages. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "You will be humming 'Welcome to the Family Madrigal' -- expositional but infectious -- all the way home. The characters are infectious, too, and well-drawn, enriching Encanto's world with gifts that extend far beyond their bestowed powers."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "\"Encanto\" may adhere to a well-worn formula but its message couldn't be more timely."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's beautiful to look at, the animation is first-class, it's full of lovely songs and quirky characters and magic, with positive messaging about family values and being yourself but, to be honest, the latest offering from Disney is a bit of a bore."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even by the fallen (and falling!) standards of contemporary Disney, this has an amazingly broken story."
    },
    {
      "text": "The result here is an enchanting Colombian tale that's suitable for the whole family."
    },
    {
      "text": "A warm and wonderful offering that speaks truthfully and respectfully to its target audience."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is all rendered absolutely beautifully, with the most impressive color palette of any animated movie in memory."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's more than a little \"Beauty and the Beast\" in \"Encanto,\" from its glasses wearing heroine to a magical abode fueled by magic (a rose under glass for \"Beast,\" a candle here)."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a little trite and hackneyed... But what distinguishes this film somewhat is a delightful weird streak."
    },
    {
      "text": "It plays like a mashup of Frozen and Coco that's trying a little too hard."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bright, lively and heart-felt slice of Disney Magic. The studio delivers another fantastic cultural exploration, with great messages morals and themes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Visually, the film is stunning, with the characters and settings ranging from luscious to comic and back again."
    },
    {
      "text": "An enchanting wonder with a big beating heart and sublime visuals, Encanto is a beautiful creation."
    },
    {
      "text": "A smiling tale about familial reconciliation and learning to see your relatives for who they are rather than who you wish they were is never unwelcome."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is enough heart and spirit to distinguish Encanto from the [Disney] catalogue, with the animated adventure setting itself up to be a rich appreciation of the perseverance and significance of Latino culture."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's enough to entertain younger audiences but I'm not convinced Encanto will be remembered as a Disney classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "For Disney to make a film about Colombian folk culture is a gorgeous, original choice. But like its best films, the universal touch carries the real magic."
    },
    {
      "text": "A thin story, dull characters, endlessly regurgitated gags, and a general air of pointlessness dog this fantasy about life in an enchanted house in an unspecified Latin country."
    },
    {
      "text": "The story makes it easy to connect with this family, with Mirabel a worthy new addition to the ever growing list of memorable Disney heroines."
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto comes to feel rather quaint, a welcome respite from the litany of bombastic animated films that all seem to follow the same tiresome schematic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Gorgeously animated, packed with brilliant voice acting, and featuring the best Disney musical sequences in recent memory, it's a film that works best when it's a bold merging of old and new..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The melodies aren't initially memorable, but the energy of the music complements the movie's dynamic direction."
    },
    {
      "text": "So see Encanto for the splendid visual and musical experience with a heartfelt message and something to talk about."
    },
    {
      "text": "Full credit to the creative team at WDAS, who have celebrated their 60th film with a story that genuinely feels unique among the studio's past work."
    },
    {
      "text": "Among other Disney musicals it's one of the studio's better efforts."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the story arc gets frustrating, the images and sounds more than compensate."
    },
    {
      "text": "Too bad this was Disney's 60th animated movie. A story written under the guidance of the most conventional algorithm and eight perfectly forgettable songs. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "What's interesting and unexpected is the film's subtle acknowledgement of culturally specific generational trauma and displacement."
    },
    {
      "text": "A magical and musical journey that will fill the audience with awe, despite being a bit formulaic and predictable. Another fantastic soundtrack from Lin-Manuel Miranda."

      "text": "\"Encanto\" lives up to its name."
    },

      "text": "Immigrant themes are realized, as well as the excellent songs and the so-luscious-it-hurts-the-eyes animation, ... especially the soulful flower power. Another Disney triumph!"
    },
    {
      "text": "Every line in every song is whip-smart and each tune seems better than the previous one."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the 60th feature film made or distributed since 1937 by Walt Disney Animation Studios, and classics such as Snow White, Pinocchio and The Jungle Book notwithstanding, it's one of the best."
    },
    {
      "text": "Joyful and triumphant, this could be the perfect festive treat."

      "text": "Encanto earns its tears."
    },
    {
      "text": "For every generic and lifeless sequel Disney churns out for monetary gain or subscriber dollars, they create an \"Encanto,\" a wonderful, stunningly (and original) animated adventure about the power and magic of family."
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto celebrates how ordinary people can be extraordinary. Vibrant and touching, it is a heaped helping of candle-lit fun and magic."
    },
    {
      "text": "While transporting audiences to a new world, this celebration of Latino culture can still rely on the foundations of family to best support itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "When you factor in its spectacular looks, Encanto has enough going for it that it isn't hard to give it a recommendation."
    },
    {
      "text": "'Encanto' is the most purely delightful, transporting Disney animated feature in some time, maybe since 'The Princess and the Frog.' And its tunes by Lin Manuel-Miranda are the best since the days of Howard Ashman and Alan Menken."

    },
    {
      "text": "...If Encanto doesn't become an instant classic on the same level as Beauty and the Beast or Frozen, it will absolutely reign supreme as its greatest hidden gem."
    },
    {
      "text": "Encanto is a celebration of Latino culture that stresses embracing our differences, and what it lacks in narrative propulsion, it makes up for in joy and sense of wonder."
    },
    {
      "text": "Vibrant, quirky, and emotionally engaging, Encanto provides a beautiful experience for the entire family. The music will stick with you long after the film ends."

    {
      "text": "If you've seen every single Disney animated feature, as I have, Encanto sits right there in that upper third."
    },

      "text": "Ultimately, it's just another by-the-numbers Disney flick."
    },
    {
      "text": "Disney's latest animated outing is full of bright colors and energy, but the songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda are surprisingly flat and the movie's internal logic falters."
    },
    {
      "text": "A pleasant but overloaded tale that works diligently to be enchanting but never manages to be much more than serviceable."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's probably a cliché by now to say that Disney made a family movie with heart, but I don't know what to tell you. They did it again."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bit too simple but still very sweet, Encanto isn't going to be a Disney classic. But it's still a solid choice for families headed to the theaters."

      "text": "It's a creative, fresh take on a story that is much more complex than your standard fairy tale."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "Another rehash of Frozen, Encanto does not have much to add to the equation. Upbeat Miranda songs become a bit monotonous."
