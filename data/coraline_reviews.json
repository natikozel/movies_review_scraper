      "text": "It would be difficult for any filmmaker to mimic Gaiman's seductively amusing and imaginative writing, and Selick, who also wrote the script, should be commended for not falling back on some golden-tongued narrator. But his Coraline could use more spunk."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "As in the Grimm Brothers stories, there's something very pagan in Coraline, something that doesn't jibe with our feelings that good always defeats evil. Rather it insists that cleverness and a little treachery is always needed to save our skins."

      "text": "A juvenile nightmare that children can gasp and giggle along with and feel a bit braver for surviving."
    },

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Visually, \"Coraline\" rests between Terry Gilliam's rudimentary \"Monty Python\" work and Pixar's prestigious polish. Every background is beautiful in a children's film that's mesmerizing and a bit bothersome at times, just as it should be."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Nightmare Before Christmas test required. If the kiddies survive that one without developing an intense fear of the boogeyman or Santa Claus, Coraline gets a green light."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Gaiman's great story and Selick's direction make it a fun few hours in the theater. Just don't take anybody under eight."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coraline is equal parts funny and frightening. This isn't a cute story for kids... but one of the most sophisticated, rewarding works of American fantasy cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "An amazing stop-motion achievement."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Selick's production is not by any stretch graphic or gory, the use of odd and irregular shapes, proportions, and movement creates a dark symphony of macabre images that horrify the psyche and chill the blood all the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "Evokes \"Beetlejuice\" and \"Pan's Labyrinth\" but is much more of a children's movie and a damned good one at that."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "This is one of those films that works best if you can forget about the source material. Selick's film is more like a three-ring circus."
    },
    {
      "text": "A wonderfully inventive film."
    },
    {
      "text": "The 3-D animation is just superb in Coraline; the imagination of Neil Gaiman has taken flight with director Henry Selick."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coraline is a genuinely creepy film that employs 3-D trickery to its best affect. A deliciously entertaining mythological adventure."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "The film combines stunning visuals - there are scenes of incredible beauty - with good old-fashioned storytelling that is funny, inventive and at times scary. Destined to be a classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie is beautifully crafted, but like the same director's other stop-motion feature, Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, it will mystify and in some cases terrify younger children."

    {
      "text": "It's easy to admire the film's psychedelic surrealism and its marvellous design, but it's not a great deal of fun."
    },
    {

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "Some scary fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "A gorgeously hand-crafted and pleasurably detailed piece of work. It's also genuinely strange, creepy and arresting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coraline is more of an odd curiosity than a must see, lacking the storytelling innovation to match its visual panache."
    },
    {
      "text": "Endlessly inventive and impeccably realised, it's tough to find fault with this freaky, feisty fable."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's not really suitable for younger children but their elder brothers and sisters will be fiendishly entranced by the best children's movie this year. Naysayers can button it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rich, ingenious and frighteningly close to home, Selick's new nightmare puts him nearer to Guillermo del Toro and David Lynch than Tim Burton. See it in 3D. Then sleep with the light on."
    },
    {
      "text": "Admirably, it never condescends, and the subtexts about child abduction and the nature of maternal love identify Coraline as something measurably apart from what traditionally passes for \"kids\" films these days."
    },
    {
      "text": "Off-beat, weird, original, intense, stunning, jaw-dropping, enthralling and ingenious, this film is a beautiful piece of work that will hold your attention and capture your heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "It lacks narrative drive, psychological depth and, most of all, warmth. This is a 'family' movie that offers an extremely dark view of human nature without providing much to relieve it."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may be a little too complex and mildly disturbing for wee ones, but its lush gothic style and amazing effects will impress film fans."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coraline may end up as a cult classic watched by students rather than their little sisters."

    },
    {
      "text": "Based on the Neil Gaiman book, this is another refreshingly dark kids' movie from Selick that never undermines its creepy story to assure undemanding audience members. And it looks utterly fantastic."
    },
    {
      "text": "This deliciously creepy fairy- tale-penned by Neil Gaiman and adapted by Nightmare Before Christmas director Henry Selick-might just be the best 3D film ever made. It is, without doubt, the best I've seen."
    },
    {
      "text": "Imagine Burton's unique, warped, off-kilter vision crossed with the darkest of Roald Dahl's kids tales in 3D and you'll come close to Coraline's warped brilliance. Disney this ain't."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's weird and wonderful stuff, with Selick using the 3D sparingly to subtly add depth and texture to this magical, macabre world."

      "text": "A delightfully dark fairy tale!"

    },
    {
