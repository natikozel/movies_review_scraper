      "text": "A heartfelt tribute to Mexican culture but more than that it is a universal story about the importance of family that is heartfelt but never saccharine."
    },
    {
      "text": "What makes the film so heartfelt and resonant is its rich exploration of family, love and memory."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thematically, Coco shows the importance of family, while respecting the elderly and remembering the dead. It's not too often family films highlight that..."

    {
      "text": "Sumptuously delightful, tenderly heartfelt with humour and culture, Coco is an emotional triumph."
    },
    {
      "text": "It can be beguiling and disappointing, culturally unique and narratively too familiar, a step forward and a stubborn refusal for the studio to mix up its formula."

    },
    {
      "text": "The music is enchanting, the visuals are stunning, and the overall family theme will have your family appreciating traditions, roots and a desire to create even more memories."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, the set design is gorgeous in the land of the dead, and the family-centered theme is a winner... however, Coco's story-line didn't wow me."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "It's not the best the studio has put out, but it's certainly the most emotionally wrought. It's almost hard to believe this is a movie for children."

    {
      "text": "If one were to describe Coco in one word, it'd be beautiful, as not only the scenarios and colours presented in this film are beautiful and astonishing, but the story as well, as it remarks in one of the most important things there are, family."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Coco] is sumptuous and sincere, with a generosity of spirit that matches Pixar's usual M.O. perfectly."

    },
    {
      "text": "Coco hits all the right notes but still feels like the same old song"
    },
    {
      "text": "Both a respectful tribute to Mexican culture and a grin-inducing, thematically powerful and intensely gorgeous adventure, Coco really is magical."
    },
    {
      "text": "The storyline and Miguel's journey through it allows for what's effectively a walking tour of Mexico's lasting contributions to art, music, movies sports and pop-culture in a way that feels genuine and \"lived.\""

    {
      "text": "After a swarm of money-grabbing sequels, it's decidedly wonderful to see Pixar returning to their core roots of delivering refreshing and original pieces of cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "The bones of the plot may be a touch more cumbersome than they should have been, but the tale is superbly vivified with humour, visual finery and pathos."
    },
    {
      "text": "Here, the dead are more than just alive; they are festive, hyperkinetic, masters of crooning, sensitive, educative and ... able to get the whole house roaring."

    },
    {
      "text": "Unkrich's 2nd feature proves that with great animation, stellar storytelling, and moving moments of emotion, animated movies are still the best forms of filmmaking out there."

    },
    {
      "text": "It may not rival 'Inside Out' or 'Toy Story' as an all-time great Pixar film, but it certainly lands in the upper echelon and is one of their better original movies in years."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coco is beautifully animated; a cute story which at times is quite moving. It may be a rather forgettable Pixar product, but in the moment, it has its charm."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coco never feels like a crass bid for foreign markets. Instead, it comes across as a celebration of the ways culture can unite us across borders."
    },
    {
      "text": "All you really need to know is this: Pixar knocks another one out of the graveyard and into the afterlife."
    },
    {
      "text": "On the whole, Coco is a stunning achievement from the most consistently impressive animation studio in the business."
    },
    {
      "text": "There really is something deliciously morbid about how Lee Unkrich and Adrian Molina depict the afterlife with such irresistible color and verve, with jovial skeletons seemingly without a care in the world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Only the coldest of hearts will make it through Coco without shedding a tear."
    },

      "text": "Several times I found myself sobbing without knowing exactly why only to realize why the scene had hit me so hard a few minutes later."

    },
    {
      "text": "It requires a lot of exposition but it's well done and once complete, this gloriously animated, musically lovely and supremely Mexican visual feast flies along."

    },
    {
      "text": "On paper, the mythology scans as complicated and dark, but in the capable hands of Academy Award winner Lee Unkrich and Pixar veteran Adrian Molina, Coco is accessible for even the youngest cinema patrons."

      "text": "A film that will become the standard-bearer of a positive example of what the Latino experience can look like on the big screen for years to come."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much to my surprise, given my initial reaction to the story, I found myself crying at the end."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's certainly a substantial improvement on recent misfires like The Good Dinosaur and last year's barrel-scraping Cars 3."
    },
    {
      "text": "Pixar ups their game every time...the music is very catchy, as warm as the theme and tone of the movie...by the end, I was a sobbing mess."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coco manages its humor and music in exact doses, not transforming the story with them, but by using them as an expressive material to continue advancing Miguel's journey. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The director, Lee Unkrich, knows how to get an audience reaching for the Kleenex, and the climax here is a similar wipeout. You have been warned."
    },
    {
      "text": "Complicated? Yes, and a little slow, too. But the animation is as colourful as the story and emotions do eventually reach the desired level."
    },
    {
      "text": "Pixar's latest project is a glittering return to non-franchise form after 2015's lacklustre The Good Dinosaur."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its victorious denouement offers everyone a different way to think about what it means to live on, and how that starts by treating those dearest to us well."
    },
    {
      "text": "The necropolis Miguel explores is a magnificent creation, a heaving, neon-lit, labyrinth...Coco has heart as well as jokes, and there are probably worse ways of introducing children to the party-pooping concept of death."
    },
    {
      "text": "At worst it suggests that the brains trust at Pixar, after 22 years of peerless output (Toy Story was 1995), is finally eating itself. At best, well, it's a superbly polished, technically flawless family film that makes you cry. And this is bad how?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Funny, irreverent and eye-popping. It will also make you want to cry at least once but possibly as many as three times."
    },
    {
      "text": "An unmissable treat for the whole family."
    },
    {
      "text": "A sumptuous, expressively animated film, as dazzling as fireworks."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'd love to see kids try and place this portrayal of Mexico alongside Trump's. Good luck with building that wall pal. Joyous."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's a fun story, emphasizing family and heritage, and the digital animation is superb."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite the fact that it's so well told and really beautifully directed, it doesn't have as investing a story as I would have liked because it does feel like other things we've seen before. But still, this is a good movie."

    {
      "text": "... Coco is another triumph for Pixar..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Funny and heart-tugging with some knockout tunes, the movie glows with warmth. And how many kids' cartoons would include a running Frida Kahlo gag? One to treasure."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film doesn't go where you initially expect it might go and is all the better for it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though in many ways it treads similar ground, Coco is a film rich in heart, so much so that the film's few flaws fail to take away from the overall experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not top-tier Pixar. But decent enough."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may lack the ingenuity of their finest outings, but this is Pixar's best film in ages. Visually splendid, frequently emotional and culturally nourishing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coco's sincerity is undeniable and its creativity often remarkable. The songs might be unlikely earworms but the film easily earns its place in your heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "Pixar has raised the animation bar again, with its most musical - and arguably most magical - film yet. If this is the afterlife we're all headed to, don't fear the reaper."
    },
    {
      "text": "For children and adults. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "A joyous musical adventure that should charm adults just as much as the kids it is aimed at."
    },
    {
      "text": "I left Coco angry that its entire plot needn't have happened if the family had ever once acted reasonably or communicated properly."
    },
    {
      "text": "Both a colourful sight to behold and an exuberant journey; a film exploding with dazzling visual and emotional fireworks."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a beautifully touching tale that has a lot of say about celebrating the past and why me must remember those who have come before us."
    },
    {
      "text": "While the animation is Pixar perfect, I don't think the story grips the viewer."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like Up before it, Coco is likely to make you shed a few tears, but here the sadness is met with joy."
    },
    {
      "text": "It seems like the kind of speculative material that would be easy to get spectacularly wrong, and it is to Disney and Pixar's credit that they've been bold enough to go there, with class, respect and ultimate integrity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Another Pixar masterpiece. It sits comfortably with Toy Story 3, Finding Dory and Inside Out as one of the best Pixar films this decade."

    {
      "text": "Not exactly top-tier Pixar..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Every plot point and thematic implication slots into place, but the pleasures of Coco are above all visual. I don't think I've ever seen a computer-animated film so rich in detail, or so dedicated to recreating complex and beautiful lighting schemes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Aside from the look of the movie, it's the themes and story that push it over the top in the best possible way. Coco explores what it is to follow your dreams, respect your family and that seeing is not always believing."
    },
    {
      "text": "... there's an overwhelming sense of deja vu about Coco."
    },
    {
      "text": "Such a film stands or falls on the quality of the music, and Coco delivers on that. The original songs are very good indeed, and the animated concerts are stupendous fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film can be seen as a model of the new wave diversity movement in Hollywood, with its story focus simultaneously acknowledging one of the world's main cultural components while, incidentally, tapping into its lucrative market."

      "text": "Coco continues Pixar's tradition of combining vibrant, detailed animation with nuanced and impactful emotional themes."
    },
    {
      "text": "The netherworld into Miguel and his ultra-adorable (and hyper-clumsy) canine sidekick Dante must journey is pure Pixar creativity at its eye-popping visual best."
    },
    {
      "text": "Coco is lush, vibrant, teeming with life and altogether delightful. And because of the authenticity and respect the film makers have shown to their story and its people, this film just bursts with joy. Bravo."

      "text": "Coco is a heartwarming story, about not only the importance of family and following your dreams, but also whether a person's mistakes are redeemable."
    },
    {
      "text": "And the animation itself is superb, its renderings of the land of the dead even more vibrant than that of the living. That's ironic. Pero también es interesante, no?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Day of the Dead, which spans the full spectrum of human emotions, proves to be an extraordinarily fertile backdrop for director Lee Unkrich and his team."
