    },

      "text": "Overall, this is a solid first-up effort for the Divergent franchise. Even though the film loses momentum in its final act as it sets up shop for next year's sequel, a majority of fans will be perfectly content with what has been achieved here."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Really the film is so intent on setting things up for, presumably, subsequent films that it forgets to be entertaining and involving in its own right, I think, and so I found this going over my head. I wasn't really interested in all of this."

    {
      "text": "The director was Neil Burger who handles the action with aplomb."
    },
    {
      "text": "The conflicts inherent in old-fashioned high school movies are accommodated, with bullying to stir the blood and romance to set the heart thumping. But Divergent's assimilation of all this fails to excite."
    },
    {
      "text": "Romance and self-realisation wrapped in violence now sell a whole lot of tickets. At least Divergent has more to ponder than most of the field."

      "text": "If one can push past the fact that its world feels a little too familiar, this is a deftly executed slice of teen sci-fi."
    },

      "text": "A brutal slog of a movie ..."
    },

      "text": "For a tale that trumpets the virtues of non-conformity, teen fantasy adventure Divergent proves disappointingly content to follow the pack."

      "text": "This is a slickly made, energetic teen sci-fi yarn, let down by its derivative and schematic storyline."

      "text": "An often entertaining, and sometimes very interesting, piece of teen SF."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even if the visuals are rather drab and the action more brisk than imaginative, there's enough menace and suspense to create an entertaining diversion."
    },

      "text": "In its sledgehammer metaphoring and scrappy, eager-to-please charm, it's easy to warm to this latest fantasy teen adaptation."
    },
    {
      "text": "Those with a high tolerance for blockbusters in which non-fetishised females save the day will be able to put up with its flaws - including lacklustre action sequences and a preoccupation with tattoos."
    },
    {
      "text": "Totalitarianism versus the individual is the basic concept of Divergent, a thrilling sci-fi adventure that is every bit as good as The Hunger Games with a dash of The Matrix added for good measure"
    },
    {
      "text": "Divergent is aimed squarely at the kind of audience who will already have watched The Hunger Games films, and the comparison does it no favours."
    },
    {
      "text": "So many derivative elements don't make it a terrible movie, but merely shoulder-shrugging predictable."
    },
    {
      "text": "What a conformist message."
    },
    {
      "text": "The blend of action, romance and political plotting is handled with smooth efficiency by director Neil Burger and Tris is an appealing, if ever so slightly dull heroine."
    },
    {
      "text": "The more you scrutinise the society Roth and these screenwriters have created, the more it seems a chintzily self-designed dystopia whose rules and entire infrastructure are pure cardboard."

    {
      "text": "An exceptional teen girl rises up from the slurry of humanity and goes on to mount a revolution against... you know the drill."
    },
    {
      "text": "The satire is not as sharp as that of The Hunger Games and the training scenes borrow heavily from the much smarter Ender's Game. But it's also stylish, tense and surprisingly pacy."
    },
    {
      "text": "A tangle of under-expressed concepts, stock characters and stock ideas, and pacing misfires."
    },
    {
      "text": "Barely diverting."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's always disappointing when a film that places so much emphasis on the need to be free-thinking and different from the masses conforms so rigidly to other movies."
    },
    {
      "text": "Smart, tough and a little bit cool, this is an intriguing opening rather than a slam-dunk in its own right, but the cast - and especially Woodley - make it sufficiently diverting to merit a place in the action franchise ranks."
    },
    {
      "text": "At its heart, Divergent is wish fulfillment for teens raised by control freaks."
    },
    {
      "text": "It was a relief to be pleasantly surprised by 'Divergent.' I was not expecting much, based on early reviews, but this is actually a good movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "I go sleep now."
    },
    {
      "text": "The story is trite and the denouement looks hasty."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's all pretty dumb, and it marks a career low for director Neil Burger, who's made some first-class indie dramas from his own scripts."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nothing more than facile, easily digested teenage wish-fulfillment based on a shaky futurist premise."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first impression left by the film is that Woodley's star quality is the main attraction in a storyline that feels too much like a Hunger Games-lite rip-off."
    },
    {
      "text": "With her performance as Tris Prior in Divergent, [Woodley] rescues and then raises up a film that could have been an utter disaster."

      "text": "Ultimately, Divergent is a mildly entertaining movie that only succeeds because of its talented cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite being filmed and set in Chicago, Divergent feels like a manufactured product churned out by the Hollywood system."
    },
    {
      "text": "While the movie's not quite accomplished enough to leave us breathlessly awaiting the next chapter (as did the last Hunger Games flick), it also doesn't leave us wanting to avoid the sequel at all costs."
    },
    {
      "text": "The hazy message, that you need to join a club, and only then think independently, is confused, and hardly the cynical dystopian satire of Orwell or Huxley."
    },
    {
      "text": "A movie so cold and monotone about its material that it plays more like an emotional concession than a full-fledged adventure."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is at its most captivating as the laws of the war-scarred world in a futuristic, decimated Chicago are laid out, and the heroine finds out what's in store for her."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, kids should embrace individuality, and yes, they should think for themselves. But this thinly veiled metaphor can be rough going sometimes, and the humorless, dumb script asks way too much of its cast."

    {
      "text": "'Divergent' is one of those movies that will have you asking question after question - and not getting any answers."
    },
    {
      "text": "Divergent has a few things going for it, but the bulk of its interesting material appears to be on back order."
    },
    {
      "text": "I can't help comparing the movie studios that crank out these young adult fantasies to the evil organizations in the movies themselves, the ones that seek to control young minds and prevent them from thinking freely."
    },
    {
      "text": "A painfully dumbed-down version of politics and human nature. It is exactly what you'd expect for a book aimed at 13-year-old kids... targeting the Twilight movie crowd."
    },
    {
      "text": "Given the seemingly endless series of sub-mediocre YA adaptations, we should be thankful for whatever we can get."
    },
    {
      "text": "The climactic chases, shootouts, and fistfights have been staged, filmed, and edited with insobriety. Visual clarity shouldn't be too much to ask from these movies, even if they fail to achieve ideological coherence."

    },
    {
      "text": "If anything's going to keep this color-by-numbers franchise afloat for that long it'll be Woodley. Her story arc may mirror that of young special heroines that came before her, but she's the most unassuming and relatable of the lot."
