    },
    {
      "text": "Inside Out 2 is too nuanced and deeply felt to be called impersonal. It takes Riley's ambivalence and crushing self-esteem issues seriously, while still mining laughs from the awkwardness she finds herself unable to shake off."
    },

      "text": "One of the most perfect of all Pixar flicks has finally been followed by a sequel that, while enjoyable, doesn’t come close to matching the giddy heights of its 2015 predecessor."

    },

    {
      "text": "With a creaky story, a total absence of logic, and the most squeaky-clean depiction of puberty you could imagine, Inside Out 2 feels less like a $200 million film and more like a cash-grab made-for-TV movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "And much like the first movie, Inside Out 2 is wildly funny, tender and sweet, and a little bit tearjerky."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Inside Out 2 might lack the emotional gut punch of some of Pixar's previous entries, it's short, sweet and competently crafted. While it might not be Pixar's best, it's also not their worst, and that's a much needed win for the studio."

    },
    {
      "text": "Inside Out 2 is an enjoyable, funny, and sometimes emotionally impactful film. But it fails to stand among Pixar’s best films because it’s too derivative of those films; and many others."

    },
    {
      "text": "This is a “coming of age” movie that is not built around trauma, but around the kinds of emotional setbacks encountered in everyday life. It is a movie with a surprisingly adult point of view, and it promotes the positive qualities of adulthood."

    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, it lacks anything akin to the first movie’s “Bing-Bong moment”, but the tension is palpable and your emotions definitely feel invested, as Anxiety threatens to destroy all the Joy in Riley’s life."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Inside Out 2 is not a masterpiece, and putting it toe-to-toe against its predecessor would be an ill-matched fight. But it’s an entertaining movie that gets the basics right and pays sufficient homage to the spirit of the original."

    },
    {
      "text": "\"Inside Out\" works on so many levels you should not be  shocked if your own emotions of Joy and Envy kick in while watching this production. The film moves at such a rapid rate there is no room for a moment of Ennui."
    },
    {
      "text": "There’s plenty of invention at the granular level: the battle within the Projection Room is smart, the sar-chasm is funny, the stream of consciousness is cute. But the story is very much the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even with Hawke missing some of the comic potential in this role, Anxiety is probably the best thing about this sequel, partly because she is never a pure villain."

    {
      "text": "“Inside Out 2″ is serviceable entertainment. That’s a sad thing to say about a Pixar film, especially when you consider they made classics like “Toy Story,” “The Incredibles,” and, well, the first “Inside Out.”"
    },
    {
      "text": "Even if it never quite seems to go far enough, the script touches on several terrific themes, cleverly playing with the way feelings become jumbled as the hormones kick in."

    {
      "text": "This thoughtful, emotional (literally!) return to the world of Riley and her colorful, expressive emotions is a worthy follow-up to the original."
    },

      "text": "Inside Out 2’s view of growing up has nothing in it as powerful or real as the When She Loved Me song from Toy Story 2 – but there are a lot of entertaining moments..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the rare Pixar sequel that truly earns its existence and deepens the message of its first film. And even though it may make you deeply, deeply, deeply anxious, it's also, quite simply, a joy to watch."
    },
    {
      "text": "Inside Out 2 in some ways reminded me of Toy Story 2. A bigger adventure, with more characters, more things to explore, & builds off the original in a beautiful way! \nReason being Inside Out 2 is another Pixar timeless classic that I completely adored."
    },
    {
      "text": "Inside Out 2 leans more towards greatness than redundancy & though it falls short of being one of Pixar's best, it's a worthy addition to the library."

    {
      "text": "You could be forgiven for thinking that this journey home will be a picaresque riot, a colorful flexing of the collective Pixar imagination, but there’s not much fun in this 13-year-old’s mind."

    },
    {
      "text": "The film’s director, Pixar animation veteran Kelsey Mann, and the screenwriters, Meg LeFauve and Dave Holstein, build on the earlier film’s playful brilliance and come about as close as we could have hoped for to matching it."
    },
    {
      "text": "So perfectly ticks Pixar’s boxes in a way that forces the sincerity of its storytelling into a losing battle with the cynicism of its existence."
    },
    {
      "text": "An imperfect but thoughtful sequel."
    },
    {
      "text": "As expected, the picture is a visual delight, as bright and shiny as Joy’s demeanour, but what’s most stirring is its willingness to tell children (and their parents) that they should not repress parts of themselves out of fear that they’ll be judged."
    },
    {
      "text": "The new characters of Inside Out 2 are a success, and the voice actors definitely help bring them to life...The only problem is that the new characters in Inside Out 2 begin to outshine the old."

    },
    {
      "text": "Works largely because the first one does wonderfully well. The new movie conforms to the original's ethos as well as inventive template, its conceit and visual design, so its pleasures are agreeably familiar."

      "text": "Inside Out 2 manages to tell us a different story while still giving us an important message in the end: It is okay to feel all your emotions, but just remember to let Joy in."
    },
    {
      "text": "This sequel knows that when you leave childish things behind, you risk leaving key parts of the child’s personality and personal growth as well. It also recognizes that young adulthood is a different game altogether."
    },
    {
      "text": "The story beats, action sequences and sentimental moments — Joy’s despair when she’s out of ideas is quite touching — are expertly fine-tuned, and the dazzling visuals no less so."
    },
    {
      "text": "Inside Out 2 will resonate with all ages, but particularly older viewers - tweens, teens, and adults. It's more mature than the first, but still delivers classic Pixar humor & heart. This one hits hard. One of Pixar's best."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is not the innovative, cutting-edge filmmaking that Pixar built its name on. What was once the product of pure imagination feels reduced to brand obligation."

      "text": "If I had a nickel for every time I reviewed a good-but-not-great 2024 sequel to a flat-out amazing 2015 film, I'd have two nickels, which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice."

    {
      "text": "It's gratifying to see an ordinary and, yes, anxious 13-year-old’s life, like millions and millions of lives right now, treated as plenty for a good, solid sequel, and without the dubious dramatics of the first movie’s climax."

    {
      "text": "Inside Out 2 is an endearing sequel with an impactful message and plenty of humor, even though the adventure follows its predecessor’s formula with only a fraction of the emotional punch."

    {
      "text": "A more than suitable and satisfactory follow-up that makes one think Pixar is making its return to greatness."
    },
    {
      "text": "The writing’s often smart... But the climax can’t touch the original’s devastating power. Instead, the best that the Pixar brain trust can concoct here, for a rousing revelatory message, is that everyone needs a hug. Oh dear."

    {
      "text": "The film’s greatest strengths are almost entirely overshadowed by similar positive attributes found in “Inside Out,” namely its humorous creativity and recognition of the importance of complex emotions to form a fully rounded human."

    },
    {
      "text": "While still mining some pitch perfect humor and laughs (the ‘Sarchasm’ is probably the film’s best pun), the film curiously shies away from going too dark."
