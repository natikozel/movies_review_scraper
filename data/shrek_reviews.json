      "text": "Turning the fairy-tale genre on its head was a clever, if not totally novel, notion at the time, and Shrek still retains much of its ironic charm 20 years later."

    {
      "text": "20 years later, Shrek remains a timeless animated classic thanks to its exceptional, highly-entertaining story, which comes packed with a multitude of amusing moments, and marvelous, fleshed-out characters that have you engaged every step of the way."

      "text": "The most effective moments arrive in the form of clever visual gags related to well-known fairy tales."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shrek is unashamed of its modern flourishes. At the same time, especially for young viewers, it works very well as a straightforward and quite funny fable. The animation, coordinated by directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is impressive."

    },
    {
      "text": "The first Oscar for Best Animated Feature went to Shrek, an absurd choice to those of us who believe that Pixar's Monsters, Inc. was that year's best toon flick. Still, this is nevertheless a snappy comedy that manages to stick it to the entire genre."

    {
      "text": "Shrek is alive, and with dark, sly and absolutely hilarious irreverence lampooning every once-sacred characteristic of the nursery kingdom. Shrek is a subversive joy.."
    },
    {
      "text": "With improbable finesse it buffs up some of the oldest tropes of storytelling and then gives them a mischievous tilt, so that we appear to be watching a celebration of a genre and a sneaky subversion of it at the same time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even more amazing, for a movie with its share of flatulence gags, it also has a real heart. Few films have had their cake and eaten it so gleefully."
    },
    {
      "text": "The best jokes in Shrek spoof Disney tradition; the villain's lair looks suspiciously like a certain theme park's Main Street USA, and a bluebird of happiness explodes during a sugary crescendo."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shrek qualifies as a classic animated movie, and one of the more charming films to grace screens in a long time."
    },
    {
      "text": "The story's simple, the quest not that complicated. But the joy of Shrek is in the telling, in the details along the way."
    },
    {
      "text": "The sarcastic, nasty tone of smug hipness clashes mightily with the film's shrill attempts at sincerity and lesson-learning."
    },
    {
      "text": "A a computer-animated burlesque fairy tale that generates more belly laughs than any live-action comedy since Best in Show."
    },
    {
      "text": "The animation, with its dimensional verisimilitude, is beguiling and the whole package ends with a noncloying dash of uplift."

    },
    {
      "text": "Shrek may not have the class of Buzz Lightyear, but he's a lovable great lunk, and you could do a lot worse this summer than see this."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's no denying that the monster-as-hero device has 90-odd-minutes worth of entertainment mileage, and the delivery of the story's moral is handled well enough to avoid tweeness."
    },
    {
      "text": "This animated fantasy comedy from DreamWorks is an irreverent, occasionally scatological fairy tale with state-of-the-art computer-generated images that almost steal a march on Toy Story."
    },
    {
      "text": "No matter which level of the movie a viewer responds to, anyone past the age of 5 who doesn't laugh repeatedly while seeing Shrek needs to have his funny bone examined."
    },
    {
      "text": "The brilliance of the voice work, script, direction and animation all serve to make Shrek an adorable, infectious work of true sophistication."
    },
    {
      "text": "The story has rollicking moments and the visuals are amazingly realistic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shrek's ability to fit in a number of touching, funny moments says much about the intelligence and wit behind it. It's just a shame that the film is never as clever or as hip as it so desperately feels the need to be."
    },
    {
      "text": "After a 90-minute onslaught of in-jokes, here's the real punch line: Shrek strives to have a heart. Supposedly there's a message about beauty coming from within, but somehow it rings hollow."
    },
    {
      "text": "The charms of Shrek, which is based on the children's book by William Steig, go far beyond in-jokes for adults."
    },

      "text": "Gross-out laughs meet a marvelous fairytale mix."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though imperfect, \"Shrek\" offers enough diversions from animation's go-go-go that it's been sad - after lackluster third and fourth installments - to see the lovable green guy turn the way of impersonal franchise cash-grabbing."
    },
    {
      "text": "It doesn't take long to figure out that Shrek is not going to be your ordinary animated fairy tale."

      "text": "Unique brand of entertainment: Simple and straightforward in its textal surface, but sophisticated and witty in subtextual connotations, including racy barbs addressed at Disney, which until recently had monopoly on animation fare, but not anynmore."
    },
    {
      "text": "What gives Shrek its special artistic distinction is its witty and knowingly sassy dialogue, delivered by vocally charismatic performers whose voices remind us of their stellar screen personae in live-action movies."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shrek is amusing and charming and it stands on it's own, but it does not rival Disney's best and I'm not saying it needs to, but that simply is the bar."
    },
    {
      "text": "A well-cast, well-made movie in which the spectacular animation, while impressive, definitely plays second fiddle to the strong story and engaging characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "Gag by gag -- and there's a stream -- it's merrily irreverent, visually and vocally. The bigger picture, though, is rather more conventional."
    },

    {
      "text": "A movie that adults will easily enjoy every bit as much as the kids, maybe even more so."
    },
    {
      "text": "A funny, well-paced, and satisfying twisted fairy tale."
    },
    {
      "text": "If \"Beauty and the Beast\" and \"The Little Mermaid\" were banquets for the eyes and ears, \"Shrek\" is an out of control food fight that's so invigorating to watch you wish it could go on forever."

      "text": "I think Shrek sucks."
    },
    {
      "text": "A contemporary, yet sophisticated, concoction that throws almost every cliché...yet casts a spell over us with its charm and inventiveness."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sort of like The Princess Bride, if André the Giant had been the hero, and had worn Lou Ferrigno body paint."
    },
    {
      "text": "At least half a dozen flatulence and poop jokes percolate through the opening credits alone. Far be it from me to poo-poo a good fart joke, but there is an art to these things, and in Shrek they just sit there."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are numerous faults in Shrek, enough to addle the brain. Chief among these are the narrative infirmities, which begin with the attempt at creating a fairytale that subverts the storytelling conventions of tradition."
