    },
    {
      "text": "While some of the plotting is obvious and dialogue a touch too portentous, as a director, Baldoni brings the same raw edge of hand-held camerawork and naturalistic lighting that marked out his Five Feet Apart as a cut-above the usual teen weepie."

    },
    {
      "text": "The film concludes by asserting that domestic violence is far more complicated than Hollywood has historically given it credit for being, and anyone can be a perpetrator or survivor. It’s a powerful statement that it doesn’t quite earn the right to make."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is far from perfect, but It Ends with Us does offer enough solid substance to honour the heaviness of its source material in a film that, for all its flaws, takes the viewer on an effective emotional ride."

      "text": "Despite its over 2-hour runtime, It Ends With Us rushes through the plot, barely allowing enough time to process or feel Lily's trauma."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a cultural statement, It Ends With Us doesn’t quite get there. As a personal exploration of what it feels like to be caught up in a cycle of violence, however, it’s a much more powerful big-screen experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "A tearjerker that indulges in its red-meat drama, but then gives it the grace of shading and complexity -- and rare humanity."

      "text": "A bungled adaptation that is at once too close to its source and too far from it."
    },
    {
      "text": "After a surfeit of montages and Ms Blake contemplating Lily's journey through a veil of melancholy, it ends as predictably as it unfolded. Dull and stale though it may be, it does have the welcome virtue of being instantly forgettable."

      "text": "Between the flat acting, cheesy storytelling, and overall weird vibes, It Ends with Us is a cinematic failure on almost every front."
    },
    {
      "text": "The frothy romance comedy lands better than the dark parts about men’s scary tempers, but on the whole, it’s one of the year’s more satisfying films."
    },
    {
      "text": "Flowers, their short-lived beauty notwithstanding, can often brighten even the bleakest day. In this movie, they're treated like something we don't deserve, a blessing closed up tight, instead of a thing worth living for."
    },
    {
      "text": "Lively is tasked with carrying the full weight of the story in “It Ends With Us” and she’s up to the challenge, but this is an uneven and turtle-paced romantic drama that feels like a missed opportunity."
    },
    {
      "text": "The controversial bestseller written by Colleen Hoover makes for good trashy material, but the underlines in the message, direction, and performance leave the movie in limbo territory."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are a few shining moments where the performances come alive, but the majority of the film feels like a cookie-cutter addition to the genre that is more focused on making checkmarks on a list than delivering something a little more nuanced."

      "text": "... downplays moral complexity and meaningful character dynamics in favor or treating weighty issues with a soap-opera gloss."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "The film teases out a darker story involving domestic abuse, but as a director, Baldoni manages to deal with it sensitively while embracing the melodrama of it all."
    },
    {
      "text": "Is this a soap opera? For a while, that seems to be the case. But be patient because It Ends With Us is something more substantial. Plus, until it gets there, it’s a good soap opera, and that counts for something."
    },
    {
      "text": "The commitment to the story and characters is unmistakable, and Baldoni elicits performances of tautly focussed, high-relief earnestness...but what remains is a mechanism of thrilling power that's missing a touch of mere humanity."

      "text": "Bravely tackles difficult themes with sensitivity and depth, leaving audiences with a lasting impression of hope and the courage to rewrite one's own story."
    },

      "text": "I went into it not expecting to be impressed by any means, but the film has the potential to resonate with its intended audience, and I have to admit that it touched my heart at moments."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie's heavy themes make it a bit weightier than a summer breeze, but \"It Ends With Us\" is the big screen equivalent of a beach read: It's light on the eyes, easy to digest and simple to walk away from once it's over."

    },
    {
      "text": "Fighting their way out of the flowery tearjerking in the film version of Colleen Hoover’s mega-bestseller are a movie and a stellar Blake Lively performance that both take measure of domestic violence and the women who get to decide when enough is enough."

    {
      "text": "It Ends with Us is an occasionally schlocky and saccharine novel, but Justin Baldoni’s film adaptation uses an ace script and stellar performances -- particularly that of lead Blake Lively -- to elevate Colleen Hoover’s story to its cinematic peak."

    {
      "text": "It Ends with Us means well, and Lively is committed to the cause. But it’s a Hallmark-esque adaptation, aimless and nondescript, with too many weepy pop tunes in the mix. They’re also pushing it with that 130-minute runtime."

    {
      "text": "A mix of tones that doesn’t always work, but often feels like a throwback to a different era of movie-making, one where the mid-budget movie willing to delve into issues was a viable business model. In that way, it’s a successful endeavor."

    {
      "text": "It can’t be denied that the audience that made [Colleen] Hoover’s initial words such a success are likely to lap up such mawkishness, but there’s a deeper, darker iteration of this story that could – and should – be told."

      "text": "Armed with a script by “Daddio” filmmaker Christy Hall, “It Ends with Us” manages to sensitively handle its delicate subject matter, though largely at the cost of a more intricate narrative."

      "text": "It’s challenging to be totally on board with a film like this since it tries too hard to tell us it’s on the heroine’s side when there’s ample evidence it’s only partially in her corner."
    },
    {
      "text": "The screenplay, by Daddio director Christy Hall, makes an effort with some early winking jokes that acknowledge the novel’s clichés. But the adaptation can’t be saved from the contrivance baked into the original text."

    {
      "text": "This dark and melodramatic story could easily have taken a turn into Lifetime territory. But Lively and her director/co-star Justin Baldoni keep it on track."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a whole, Baldoni's directorial effort isn't made for the fans who were drawn in by the love triangle, but rather intended for the audiences who resonate with Lily's journey, and maybe that is for the better."
    },

      "text": "This is a visually striking film that struggles to balance its artistic vision with the weight of its subject matter. The result is an adaptation that leaves the viewer wishing for a more grounded and sincere portrayal of its poignant themes."
