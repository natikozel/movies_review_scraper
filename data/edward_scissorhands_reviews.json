    {
      "text": "With equal portions of humor and heart, this inventive, touching, poetic fairy tale is highly memorable."
    },
    {
      "text": "For a guy who has made some really great movies, this is very much one of Burton’s best and most heart-wrenching."
    },
    {
      "text": "The finale packs an unforgettable emotional wallop, assisted by Danny Elfman's gloriously magical score."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is one of Burton’s best and it’s one of aesthetic power and emotional resonance. It’s a magical odyssey of invention and human emotion, with a distinguishable tone and look. \nThis one is for the weirdos."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tim Burton's most iconic film is a fairy tale about the way art is used to reflect on both traditional society and the artist's inability to fit into it."
    },
    {
      "text": "... this paean to misfit outcasts and misunderstood artists is ultimately a magical and melancholy fairy tale for the modern world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Burton was clearly in line with a poetic atmosphere but it escapes him in the end. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "It looks and feels original and new; startling, yet at the same time comforting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edward Scissorhands is a flashy and entertaining apologia from an artist who has not accumulated enough work to justify such self-concern."
    },
    {
      "text": "The highest praise must be reserved for Mr. Depp, who, as the hero, manages to evince a gentle charm in spite of being encrusted with several ounces of make-up."
    },
    {
      "text": "Long a courageous actor, Depp inhabits a character that by all accounts should have been a freak or caricature."
    },
    {
      "text": "One-of-a-kind fairytale for adults from director Tim Burton."
    },
    {
      "text": "Watching the film is like turning the pages of a small child's book which has very pretty pictures and two lines of large print spelling out the story."
    },
    {
      "text": "With Burton's surreal illustrative ingenuity, Depp and Ryder's career-making performances, and a story filled with simplicity, complexity, and intangible wizardry that stands the test of time, Edward Scissorhands is one of the greatest films ever made."
    },
    {
      "text": "Depp cuts a haunting figure, while Wiest is typically excellent. The rest of the actors are forced to play characters who are either underdeveloped or overcooked, and the broadness of Burton's approach eventually leads to a wholly unsatisfying resolution."
    },
    {
      "text": "Burton's modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts."
    },
    {
      "text": "Between this masterpiece and that other Ed (Wood), TIm Burton and Johnny Depp are at their dual-career best. Ed Wood is about how insane Hollywood is -- and Edward Scissorhands delivers the pure magic that, once in a rare while, escapes the place."
    },
    {
      "text": "...perhaps the cinema's most enchanting parable about the misunderstood and alienated artist."
    },
    {
      "text": "... this sweet 1990 fantasy ... for the first time crystallized the latent themes in the director's work: the notion of the artist as outsider, of skills that make one special but at the same time different."
    },
    {
      "text": "An original movie, though not Tim Burton's best."
    },
    {
      "text": "A delightful and delicate comic fable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fine performances all around, particularly from Depp and the immensely sympathetic Wiest."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's visually pleasing and an easy film to like, even if it never gets out of shallow water as far as its story goes."

      "text": "Johnny Depp and Tim Burton in magical collaboration."
    },
    {
      "text": "A personal film for Tim Burton, which also serves as a parable about the artist as an outsider, this lovely fairytale began the long, fruitful collaboration with the endlessly versatile Johnny Depp."

      "text": "Moody and bizarre modern fairytale that works on a number of levels."
    },
    {
      "text": "Definitely one of Burton's masterpieces, maybe THE one."

    {
      "text": "A modern fairy tale about a deformed outsider whose innocence and gentle nature make him a freak in the eyes of the community he visits."

      "text": "A poetic outing by Burton with Depp offering one of his initial outsider performances. Still fun to watch."
    },
    {
      "text": "Mr. Burton invests awe-inspiring ingenuity into the process of reinventing something very small."
    },
    {
      "text": "Especially rewarding for those who would like to see something different in a film."
    },
    {
      "text": "A charming, utterly original fable with a darkness that would be surprising in a mainstream release were it not the work of Tim Burton."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tim Burton's finest achievement. It has an emotional wallop to go with his visual wizardry."
    },
    {
      "text": "Probably Tim Burton's best film. Certainly his most moving."
    },
    {
      "text": "Burton's richly entertaining update of the Frankenstein story is the year's most comic, romantic and haunting film fantasy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Enchantment on the cutting edge, a dark yet heartfelt portrait of the artist as a young mannequin."
    },
    {
      "text": "Johnny Depp is excellent as the Chaplinesque title character and the support cast is good too."
    },
    {
      "text": "Burton has a good central premise working here, but he never really grabs us..."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of my favorite films ... and one that touches me deeply."
    },
    {
      "text": "An engaging film, one which falls early in director Tim Burton's career, helping to highlight a remarkable decade's run of moody, quirky and goofy films."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tim Burton and Johnny Depp come close to achieving perfection in this dream tale."
    },
    {
      "text": "Depp is perfectly cast, Burton builds a surrealistically funny cul-de-sac world, and there are some very funny performances from grownups Dianne Wiest, Kathy Baker and Alan Arkin."
    },
    {
      "text": "Burton has not yet found the storytelling and character-building strength to go along with his pictorial flair."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edward Scissorhands is quite a surprise, an utterly enchanting fairy tale."
    },
    {
      "text": "Burton has finally found the magic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film has an unapologetically adolescent purity about it that transcends what would ordinarily be the shortcomings of its script."
    },
    {
      "text": "The romanticism has a personal dimension -- for Edward is, of course, Burton's surreal portrait of himself as an artist: a wounded child converting his private darkness into outlandish pop visions. Like Edward, he finds the light."

  "synopsis": "A scientist (Vincent Price) builds an animated human being -- the gentle Edward (Johnny Depp). The scientist dies before he can finish assembling Edward, though, leaving the young man with a freakish appearance accentuated by the scissor blades he has instead of hands. Loving suburban saleswoman Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter (Winona Ryder). However, despite his kindness and artistic talent, Edward's hands make him an outcast.",
