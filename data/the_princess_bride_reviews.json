      "text": "Whatâ€™s unacceptable about this threadbare fantasy is its contemporary irrelevance. Reiner and Goldman betray the instructional tradition that fables and legends pass on."

    {
      "text": "a charming and utterly disarming swashbuckling fairy tale that is also a smart, funny satire of swashbuckling fairy tales"

      "text": "... there is no bad version of \"The Princess Bride.\" There is only what you take away from it."

    {
      "text": "Few films have ever walked the thin line between earnestness and irony so flawlessly."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film was always wonderful, featuring clever conceits plus perfect looking cast members and locations."
    },
    {
      "text": "As the picture practically spoofs the endeavors of Douglas Fairbanks and Errol Flynn, it's also competent enough to craft its own identity as a swashbuckling thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its well-developed characters and situations take us back to the literary myths of the genre as well as the language of classic cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]"

    {
      "text": "The cult of The Princess Bride is still strong 32 years after its release."
    },
    {
      "text": "Everything about The Princess Bride is ... charming. By far, the film's dialogue is its most enduring legacy."
    },
    {
      "text": "...a lavish studio spectacle..."

    {
      "text": "One of the all-time great fantasy movies, channelling both a rollicking spirit of adventure and genuinely uplifting humour all ages can appreciate."
    },
    {
      "text": "A film that's for just about everyone and anyone that can appreciate good storytelling, a classic romance, riveting action, and genuinely funny comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Mandy Patinkin, an actor not known for humor, is particularly wonderful as Inigo, a Spaniard out to avenge the death of his father at the hands..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It manages to be both tongue-in-cheek and achingly sincere."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Princess Bride is a worthy descendant to the Fractured Fairytales of yore. The characters -- both real and imaginary -- give every frame of The Princess Bride its own magic mirth."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an adventure which reaches back to golden-age Hollywood and the devil-may-care world of Douglas Fairbanks or Tyrone Power playing Zorro, or Errol Flynn playing Robin Hood."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Princess Bride easily transcends expectations, as a fantasy that has a few pertinent things to say about the genre, including the odd fact that the heroes of such things are often prettier than the heroines."
    },
    {
      "text": "A unqualified success that blends New York wit with timeless storytelling; a risky piece of filmaking that never feels so."
    },
    {
      "text": "...it's ultimately not difficult to see why The Princess Bride has become something of a classic in the years since its 1987 release."

    },
    {
      "text": "In spirit The Princess Bride recalls The Neverending Story, which also was about a contemporary boy`s fantastic adventure. Reiner's film is likely to please adults more than kids and to last in memory more than most films this fall."
    },
    {
      "text": "Patinkin, the most dazzling movie swordsman since Errol Flynn, steals the movie with his athletic grace and delivery of lines like: \"My name is Inigo Montoya! Prepare to die!\""
    },
    {
      "text": "Mandy Patinkin, as Inigo Montoya, deserves special mention. Inigo is the one character in the film who contains real emotional depth, and Patinkin plumbs it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Patinkin's performance is especially touching. He can say, \"My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die\" -- and make you laugh, cry and cheer at the same time. The movie, two hours of pure enchantment, has the same effect."

      "text": "It's as good as you remember."
    },
    {
      "text": "Heroic fantasies, we often feel, should be lighter than air, hot as dragon fire, fast as a sword in sunlight. And that's mostly what we get from the delightful The Princess Bride -- along with some bracing humor and foolery."
    },
    {
      "text": "Action and laughs blend deliciously in this fairy-tale spoof about true lovers who must defeat all sorts of villains to reach true happiness."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film works well enough, providing its fair share of laughs and thrills, and in technical terms it is by far Reiner`s most professional job of direction."

      "text": "An unexpected delight for all the family."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shall we re-wind and give it another spin? As you wish..."
    },
    {

      "text": "Witty, winsome fairy tale for the whole family."
    },
    {

      "text": "There is so much to latch onto in this movie, so much for each member of a family that watches it together to love."

    },
    {
      "text": "One of the hottest cult videos of the 1980s, and a family classic besides, enjoyed by new generations of youngsters as well as their parents."
    },
    {
      "text": "Based on William Goldman's novel, this is a post-modern fairy tale that challenges and affirms the conventions of a genre that may not be flexible enough to support such horseplay."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rob Reiner's friendly 1987 fairy-tale adventure delicately mines the irony inherent in its make-believe without ever undermining the effectiveness of the fantasy."

    {
      "text": "The Princess Bride defies categorization; it's a unique, magical movie that deservedly became a cult favorite and instant classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The leads are vacuous; the absurdities sometimes forced and obvious."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the Top films of the 1980s - if not, of all time. A treasure of a film that you'll want to watch again and again"

    {
      "text": "Since its release more than 15 years ago, The Princess Bride has often been copied, but never equaled."
    },
    {
      "text": "This material might easily have lent itself to broad parody or become too cute for its own good. But Mr. Reiner presents it as a bedtime story, pure and simple."

    {
      "text": "[A] whimsical, comedic fairy tale."
