    },
    {
      "text": "I enjoyed and laughed at Ted, but I can't say I liked it; MacFarlane lacks focus, the jokes are occasionally offensive, and though the movie has heart, it bungles whatever message it's trying to get across."

      "text": "With Ted, MacFarlane has produced a genuinely laugh-a-minute yarn which warms the heart and tickles the funny bone into hysterical submission."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you're fundamentally put off by MacFarlane's brand of comedy, Ted's cruder elements may well prove too irksome, but this film does have a sweetness at its heart that is pleasantly unexpected, even if it does follow an extremely predictable plot."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Less a movie, more a ragbag of 80's pop cultural references hung on a storyline."
    },
    {
      "text": "Underneath the fur-ious comedy of Ted is the standard skeleton of a traditional rom-com complete with a conservative ending. Ted does not really work as a fully rounded film but feels more like three episodes of a sitcom strung together."

      "text": "Only a protracted fight between the titular fuzzball and a well-cast Mark Wahlberg begins to tap into the absurd potential of the concept."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "A pet project padded out to feature-length, bromance-meets-romance predictability. The story beats are so obvious they seem tapped out on a telegraph. If you want to see a Boston bruin who was truly interesting, watch a documentary about Bobby Orr."
    },
    {
      "text": "A fabulous first live-action effort, combining R-rated hilarity with skilled storytelling as it slips some real heart into the stuffing of a toy bear."
    },
    {
      "text": "An ugly-looking film, with the expected ugly jokes and extended pop-culture riffs, but, like the similarly scattershot 'Family Guy,' its holds your interest even as it annoys."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tami-Lyn, the little boy's dream girl who is so easy to mock, despise, and dismiss, is Ted's least imaginative take on magic."

    },
    {
      "text": "Ted is, in the end, a terminally uneven and barely-passable debut from MacFarlane that, when compared to his superior work in television, can't help but come off as a serious disappointment."
    },
    {
      "text": "The shock value of seeing a big fluffy teddy bear cursing and getting high... [provides] most of the comedy, while the startlingly easy rapport that Whalberg and a CGI effect share provides the warmth."

      "text": "Fluctuating between crass and sentimental without being particularly impressive at either, Ted wears out its welcome very, very fast."
    },

    },

      "text": "Plying his trade in pop culture references and surprising punchlines, MacFarlane jumps the adult-oriented comedy bandwagon with a film that's smarter and funnier than most"
    },

      "text": "What interests MacFarlane is the business of funny, and a talking teddy bear (particularly one with a healthy sex drive) is pretty funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rude as hell, funny as hell...While merrily delivering all the coarse anti-PC humour the Family Guy fanbase have a right to expect, the best thing about Ted is also its biggest surprise - it has real heart."

      "text": "A movie about a come to life foul mouthed teddy bear is not my idea of entertainment"

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "When Ted isn't funny, it isn't much of anything. It's the sip of water a stand-up comedian takes between jokes, leaving the audience to twiddle their thumbs as they wait for the next one."

  "synopsis": "When John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) was a little boy, he made a wish that Ted (Seth MacFarlane), his beloved teddy bear, would come alive. Thirty years later, foul-mouthed Ted is still John's constant companion, much to the chagrin of Lori (Mila Kunis), John's girlfriend. Though Lori's displeasure is exacerbated by the pair's constant consumption of beer and weed, she's not the one who's most disappointed with John; it may take the intervention of John's boyhood toy to help him grow up at last.",
