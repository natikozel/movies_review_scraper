      "text": "An amazing cocktail of martial arts, shootouts, philosophy, romance, fantasy, revolutionary visual effects and perfect casting. “The Matrix” surprised us 25 years ago, and it continues to surprise us in the Year of Our Lord 2024. Full review in Spanish."

    {
      "text": "The Wachowskis proceed to turn the world as we know it into a virtual reality landscape with a 20th century tech-noir look (lit with a sickly green hue, like the glow of an old IBM computer screen) and the physics of a video game."

      "text": "A $60 million, high-tech assault on the senses and a pretentious insult to the mind."

      "text": "A cyberpunk thriller that's so much fun to watch, it could single-handedly reboot the genre."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Wachowskis seem to be saying that while state-of-the-art effects speak for themselves, loud and clear, there's still room amid all the kicking and shooting and shouting for the carefully observed human emotion."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though The Matrix ultimately overdoses on gloom-and-doom grunge, over-elaborate cool and especially running time, it's just clever enough to enable [the Wachowskis] to nix the sophomore jinx following 1996's Bound."
    },
    {
      "text": "I know almost nothing of the intricate techniques that make The Matrix as eye-filling as it is brain-numbing, but I can tell you that... [its visuals] are wondrous to behold."

      "text": "If you're looking for a good spring fix of existentialist sci-fi, look no further than The Matrix -- then do everything you can to look deeper than the skin-tight surface."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although it's sometimes too confounding for its own good and a little heavy on the Zen-inspired techno-babble, The Matrix is a consistently absorbing assault on the senses."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's more form than content in The Matrix, but Bill Pope's swooping, noir-inflected cinematography is wonderfully complemented by Owen Paterson's inventive production design, a great soundtrack and the best fight choreography this side of Hong Kong."
    },
    {
      "text": "Give [the Wachowskis] an A for effort and three A's for those effects. The Matrix is a dazzlingly original visual adventure."
    },
    {
      "text": "Casting the robotic Reeves as the hope of humanity may be this oppressively long, self-satisfied movie's funniest gag, but it doesn't really make the game any fun. It means we get stuck with the least interesting player."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix's pleasures are considerable, but they're all purely visceral, too, lacking the mythology that would have elevated the movie. The movie is best taken as the first entry in a brand-new genre: post-modern sci-fi pulp."

    },
    {
      "text": "Visually, at least, The Matrix more than lives up to its billing. Writer-directors [the Wachowskis] seem to literally bring the screen to life with action scenes that define the word kinetic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix isn't a film that is acted, exactly, but Reeves and Fishburne are both just swell and Weaving is a lot of fun as bad Agent Smith. And some of the small ideas are intriguing ones. They're the stuff of which sci-fi classics are made."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's rare, and kind of touching, really, to see a lushly financed studio spectacular work so hard to keep everyone's attention. And with enough symbolism to keep online chat rooms busier than the day Babylon 5 was cancelled."
    },
    {
      "text": "With pounding assurance, The Matrix scores as a real triumph of technical special-effects-driven filmmaking. Sad, though, that the Wachowskis end up letting the machines run away with the show."
    },
    {
      "text": "A complete lack of story logic, coupled with the narrative's propensity for meandering mumbo-jumbo, makes this a movie best seen and not heard."
    },
    {
      "text": "I found The Matrix more interesting than a lot of other action films because the plot wasn't laid out simplistically just so the bad guys could get their comeuppance from the goodies."

    {
      "text": "The Matrix asks you to root for the freedom-loving rebels against the robotic agents, but both seem equally mechanical."
    },
    {
      "text": "What could be heavy-handed or just plain corny ends up as good science fiction should -- provoking thought and eliciting questions about our Now by handing us a Future unthinkable but at the same time quite plausible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anyone caught in the act of taking The Matrix seriously definitely needs to reboot. But then, so what? It's jolly good fun anyway. That's because it's a sterling specimen of that new cinematic genre, cyber-twaddle."
    },
    {
      "text": "While the new sci-fi thriller The Matrix won't win any prizes for its script or its acting, it may be the most outlandish feat of futurism since Blade Runner."
    },
    {
      "text": "What we are seeing here is the death of one kind of cinema and, possibly, the birth of another. One that's getting closer to the computer games that people play at home... The Matrix doesn't succeed on any other level except this."
    },
    {
      "text": "The constant temptation during The Matrix is to giggle at its absurdity while marvelling at its visual verve. But in Wachowski world, giggling doesn't seem an unacceptable option. One leaves the cinema feeling raucous and light-headed."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's much to relish in this virtuoso slice of sci-fi nonsense. Forget trying to follow the garbled plot; it's just a peg on which to drape all manner of visuals."

    },
    {
      "text": "By the time you've reached the end of its breathtaking, mind-popping ride, the last thing you'll want to worry your head about is whether it made any sense."
    },
    {
      "text": "[It seems] the Wachowskis are part of the multimedia generation of filmmakers to whom technology is no longer the means but the end itself. In which case the future looks terminal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rarely has a blockbuster been so enjoyable. Superbly staged and edited, it never loses its drive and intrigue. Reeves has come a long way as an actor since the woeful Johnny Mnemonic, and so has the entire cyberpunk genre on screen."
    },
    {
      "text": "Some of the best science fiction of recent times have convinced us that something important is at stake in what happens to the characters. But the Wachowskis' plot seems to be in the service of the special effects rather than the other way around."
    },
    {
      "text": "The visual effects are impressive, but the movie’s overall style is wearing... The cumulative effect is perversely deflationary: long before it’s over, the film has flushed the paranoia from its system."
    },
    {
      "text": "An eye-popping but incoherent extravaganza of morphing and superhuman martial arts. Ultra-cool visuals that truly deliver something new to the sci-fi action lexicon will make this time-jumping thriller a must-see among genre fans."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tediously silly and way too long, this defiantly deadening cyber-fantasy is too illogical to be science fiction, too dark to amuse photography buffs and too dreary to entertain special-effects fanatics."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extremely good at translating comics to film, [the Wachowskis] know all the tricks of diversion. Their latest film, The Matrix, doesn't make a whit of sense but it's so much fun audiences won't care what they're supposed to learn."
    },
    {
      "text": "As a special effects tour-de-force and example of producer Joel Silver's credo that nothing exceeds like excess, it exerts a campy, kinetic appeal. The Matrix is so awful, it's almost awesome."
    },
    {
      "text": "An amazing-looking movie crammed with how-did-they-do-that special effects of startling inventiveness. As narrative, The Matrix can hardly be called original, but at least the Wachowskis rip off the best."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Wachowskis have created a film that is often thrilling to watch but maddening to think about. The plot is weak and the dialogue combines technical manual language with half-baked religious cant. But Weaving makes a deliciously detestable [villain]."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a film so gorged on computer game aesthetics that the theatre seats ought to have joysticks... It's already a hit after one weekend in the U.S., but for me, \"Game Over\" was a long time coming."
    },
    {
      "text": "For a cyber-techno action thriller, though, the film lacks imagination."
    },
    {
      "text": "Given a budget that encourages their kinesthetic skills, the filmmakers tend to go on a bit, but it's mostly a kind of quick, glancing hipness that's being indulged here. And that's a rare and welcome commodity in mass-market moviemaking these days."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's not just that The Matrix is to overblown silliness as Mount Rushmore is to big stone heads. To demonstrate their power, the makers of this trailer/video game/theatrical come-on have taken something precious to me... and tossed it onto the fire."

      "text": "The Matrix offers the most exhilaratingly inventive action sequences to come down the pike in years."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's to the credit of \"Matrix\" that descriptions of its plot have to be generic. It contains a ton of surprises and mostly makes sense on its own daffy terms."
    },
    {
      "text": "[The Wachowskis] ought to get credit for the striking visual effects... Too bad the Wachowskis couldn’t plug all that hardware into a story able to sustain anyone’s interest past the first 30 minutes. Is it too late to take the other pill?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix slams you back in your chair, pops open your eyes and leaves your jaw hanging slack in amazement. Though it stumbles occasionally into ponderous exposition and some unintentional giggles, it's a smashing entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Outside of the scenes of hysterical destruction and moderate suspense, the rhythms of The Matrix are positively languorous; where there isn't hard-core action, shots shift like water lapping against a disinterested shore."
    },
    {
      "text": "Any description of this smart futuristic thriller is inadequate in conveying the striking visual wonders within."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much of the time, you wonder what all the fighting is about. At 135 minutes, the movie seems longer than a millennium."
    },

      "text": "The Matrix is a journey into a genuinely original vision of our cyber-future that will have you checking your own reality by the time it's over."
    },
    {
      "text": "A smartly calibrated mix of thrills and thoughtfulness, The Matrix sends you out of the theater looking forward to the sequel. When was the last time you felt that way about a movie?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The writing remains more intelligent than most thrillers, and the action is executed with such panache that even if you don't buy the reality of The Matrix, it's a helluva place to visit."
    },
    {
      "text": "The performances by Fishburne, Moss, and Hugo Weaving as a relentless agent are noteworthy, but the real stars of The Matrix are [the Wachowskis] and their slick, gothic future world."
    },
    {
      "text": "Supposedly, [the Wachowskis] have been working on The Matrix since before they made Bound. Unfortunately, they seem to have been busy adding to it rather than paring and simplifying. Their script manages to be both silly and dense."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix became an achievement in blockbuster filmmaking as soon as it was released. It remains one of the most quotable, memorable, and enjoyable films to throw on for a few hours."
    },
    {
      "text": "By remaining so accessible yet thoughtful, The Matrix transcends its narrative downfalls through its influence and insight—characteristics that continue to define the Wachowskis' unique brand of ambitious entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix does a good job of repackaging Baudrillard’s critique of hyperreality, as well as riffing on Christ, Marx, Lewis Carroll, and L. Frank Baum."
    },
    {
      "text": "A cinematic landscape without The Matrix would be as barren as the scorched earth above Zion."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Wachowski sisters tackle the most gigantic questions known to humanity -- reality, identity, knowledge, causality, memory -- with a spirit of play."
    },
    {
      "text": "Generally as intellectually rewarding as it is viscerally captivating."
    },
    {
      "text": "While certain aspects have now lost their shine, either due to outdated CG or just being parodied so damn much, they can't take away from the original's pull, even in 2021."
    },
    {
      "text": "Overall, for a complicated scenario, things are pretty tight story wise and the film noir feel adds to the aesthetics."

      "text": "To say that it must be seen for yourself is no understatement."
    },

      "text": "The Matrix isn't just a movie, it's an entire philosophy that also examines metamorphosis and personal transformation to mirror The Wachowskis' own personal journeys as trans women."
    },
    {
      "text": "The [Wachowskis] have \"borrowed\" bits from here, there, and everywhere, and they have ended up creating a two hour and fifteen minute jumble of cultural and philosophical references with violence to spare, but precious little clarity or logic."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix still stands up as a fiercely exciting and discombobulating futurist drama, which pioneered breathtaking \"bullet-time\" action sequences inspired by Asian martial arts."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix is an inner-circle sci-fi Hall of Famer, a visual trendsetter, and a cultural touchstone that remains culturally prominent today."
    },
    {
      "text": "Neo offers Reeves the perfect combination of Ted Theodore Logan's curiosity and wonder, Johnny Utah's earnestness and the badassedness of Jack Traven."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix comes across as hallucinatory cinema. The success of the film is that these mesmerizing hallucinations tie in so intricately with the picture’s themes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Full to the brim with eye-popping effects and \"How'd they do that?\" stuntwork, it yearns to have audiences be utterly enraptured in its created reality."
    },
    {
      "text": "It’s still just goofy fun, but its perspective reminds us that all voices need a seat at the table. The Kung Fu Awesome is just a way to connect to the bigger picture -- ludicrous and over-the-top, but reveling in an all-too-rare fresh perspective."
    },
    {
      "text": "A technologically stunning movie that furthers the genre and features crowd-pleasing performances to go with the frequent scenes of gunplay and violence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extremely violent, extremely preposterous, extremely entertaining, The Matrix succeeds at two extremely difficult tasks: as a vast, exciting virtual-reality movie and as a defibrillator for Keanu Reeves' big screen career."
    },
    {
      "text": "The effects are astonishing. It's funny, it's dark, it's smart and it's filled with guns, lots of guns. A landmark film and quite possibly the ultimate expression of cyberpunk."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix is a movie experience like no other, and experience is what it's all about. It explodes with dazzling visuals and a transcendent sense of excitement."

    },
    {
      "text": "The Matrix is tough to explain, but then how much explaining does an amusement park ride require?"
    },
    {
      "text": "In its cavalier and wasteful manner, The Matrix, directed by the Chicago-based team of [the Wachowskis], achieves a brazenly chic high style -- black-on-black, airborne, spasmodic."
    },
    {
      "text": "As far as sheer spectacle goes, it's the most exciting thing to come along in quite a while. Where other films are done in by the freedom offered by computer effects, The Matrix integrates them beautifully."
    },
    {
      "text": "Inspired by different sources (including Japanese anime), The Matrix is a new kind of movie, a visionary mixture of technology, philosophy and thrilling action."
    },
    {
      "text": "Exploding with spine-tingling, sensational special effects, The Matrix dazzles with sci-fi intrigue and mind-boggling technological concepts, effectively pitting perceptions of reality against fantasy, the future with the present."

    },
    {
      "text": "Us it the \"most dynamic sci-fi since Blade Runner\"? Hardly, as it rips off from other sources too much to have its own style. But its definitely one of the best sci-fi films in the last few years."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "There is no denying that fact that [the Wachowskis] have amazing imagination and vision. They direct the film with non-stop style and imbue each scene with enough eye-candy to make you stop noticing the gaping plot holes and lapses in logic."

      "text": "This film is triumph of style over substance."

      "text": "The problem with The Matrix is that the enormously talented [Wachowskis] think their playful premise has metaphysical implications."

    },
    {
      "text": "This is not a brainless actioner that leaves your cerebrum pounding like the heavy metal tunes featured in the film. No, The Matrix is quite possibly the greatest video game film ever made without being based on an actual video game."
