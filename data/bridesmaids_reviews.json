      "text": "It's a movie about women going berserk over a wedding. Easy non-feminist laughs are built right in there, and milked for all they're worth. No amount of sad female faces during lugubrious pop song interludes can make this more meaningful than it is."

      "text": "Here is Kristen Wiig's star turn. She co-writes, co-produces and headlines Bridesmaids, playing a woman who's, I dunno, roughly 26 percent comedically psychotic, but not so loony that she goes over the edge from sympathetic to repellent."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "It shows the dark side of people to a surprising extent for a comedy. It isn't exactly a black comedy or a dark comedy, but it does explore the way that friends can sometimes become jealous and sabotage each other."
    },

      "text": "Kristen Wiig, between her screenplay and fearlessly funny performance, gives nothing less than a tour de force."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Paul Feig's Bridesmaids ends up living in the memory like most weddings do; you went, you had a pleasant time, and unless somebody mentions the happy couple, you never think about the experience again."

    },
    {
      "text": "Whether it says something incisive about female friends and their inability to truly feel comfortable and rise above petty jealousies and competition, Bridesmaids never achieves the wolf pack camaraderie that The Hangover executes so naturally."
    },

      "text": "There are things to like here and the idea is a noble one. But in execution, \"Bridesmaids\" is a typical chick flick just with some extra rude words and vomit."

      "text": "At 125 minutes, 'Bridesmaids' is long for a comedy, but it earns its running time by fully developing its characters and their relationships ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie won't change your life or grab a fistful of Oscar nominations come next winter. But it will make you laugh, hard and often, and it proves that sometimes girls just want to have fun."

      "text": "A bridal-shower blast of brassy hilarity and a cast of ferociously funny females."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bridesmaids turns the gross-out comedy genre on its head and emerges bigger and better than its predecessors. It boasts unforgettable breakout performances and is the most important comedy of the year. And the best."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is liberating to see a woman-centered comedy of misbehavior; better still to see half a dozen women share in demolishing the froufrou imperative of American dream weddings; but best of all to hear Wiig voice her character's real thoughts."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's bawdy and a bit rowdy -- the comedy equivalent of a Lady Remington shaver in that it's just as good as the original Remington for men, only a bit smaller -- and pink."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wiig's brand of comedy is loud, proud and just gosh darned funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "Never does Bridesmaids ever aim for truly biting commentary, opting to settle instead for a series of poop jokes and scenes of social awkwardness."
    },
    {
      "text": "Is it funny? Yes, at times, and its female-centric theme will appeal to many women. I just hope they have the patience to trudge through the slow spots and story detours. Bridesmaids, which might as easily bear the title Women Behaving Badly"

    },
    {
      "text": "Indeed pretty much a rom-com in the end - but hugely enjoyable, fresh and rude, both touching and funny, all the way."
    },

      "text": "It's something old, something new, something borrowed and (cough) something very, very blue."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is real depth to the characterizations and friendships. It is so funny because it is all so painfully real."
    },
    {
      "text": "As it turns out, fart and poo gags ARE universal, as demonstrated by the mostly female audience completely losing it during some of the more off-colour scenes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sharply written and winningly performed, it delivers more laughs than any movie released this year, but also, the longer it goes on, develops into a surprisingly poignant evocation of self-scuppering loneliness."
    },
    {
      "text": "The full horror of being a bridesmaid is shown, but Wiig persuades you there is something genuinely loving and sisterly to be found at the end of this incredible ordeal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bridesmaids strives a little too hard in places to show that women can do outrageous gross-out comedy too - but it remains the best chick flick in years."
    },
    {
      "text": "By treating funny women as normal people, Wiig has crafted a game-changing comedy that's even better than The Hangover."
    },
    {
      "text": "Really, bottom line: it's the best thing Apatow's put his name to in years."
    },
    {
      "text": "Impressively directed and brilliantly written, this is a consistently hilarious and superbly acted comedy that finally gives Kristen Wiig the lead role she deserves."

    },
    {
      "text": "A guaranteed good time, be you lady or gentleman."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is artistically dishonest and embarrassingly naive to grant the status of \"classic\" to something only newly born. For a film to be called a classic, it must first stand...oh hell, who am I kidding? Bridesmaids is an instant classic."
    },
    {
      "text": "A confident, self-assured comedy with nothing to prove. Fresh, occasionally foul-mouthed, and funny."
    },

      "text": "Finally, a female ensemble comedy that balances realistic characters with smart laughs and side-splitting farce."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the funnier comedies (of the) year (certainly better than The Hangover Part II), but the flat patches make the film... feel a tad long."

    },
    {
      "text": "Bridesmaids is just fall-down funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "I suspect that Wiig is funnier when she's not so frenetically intent on finding 101 ways to make a fool of herself."
    },
    {
      "text": "The real problem is that Annie veers dangerously close to being unlikeable although Kristen Wiig's performance is so winning that she just about gets away with it."
    },
    {
      "text": "It also made me laugh so much I had a coughing fit and saw stars -- and I can't remember the last time a film of any \"gender\" made me do that."

    },
    {
      "text": "Not the chick flick it sounds like, Bridesmaids is The Hangover with skirts... hilarious and a bit of a miracle at a time when a major studio tries to force-feed audiences such cookie-cutter dreck as a PG-13 remake of Arthur."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its often raw humour, rough language and soft heart, Bridesmaids is not a frilly girlie movie, more a busty, raunchy strut-it film"
    },

    },
    {
