    {
      "text": "Led by Cillian Murphy, the film with standout performances from Robert Downey Jr, Matt Damon and more, was a visual spectacle that one couldn’t look away from. The reactions to the moment the bomb explodes onscreen can only be described as dramatic."

      "text": "What might be surprising is that dropping the bomb is not that moment in history, Nolan is more interested in how one misinterpretation of a conversation can have long lasting effects."

    {
      "text": "Oppenhiemer is a return to form for Nolan after the fiasco of Tenet. There's a great movie hiding amidst all of the formal pyrotechnics. But I guess it's too much to ask for a lighter touch from a director who is about as subtle as an atomic bomb."

      "text": "Christopher Nolan’s latest is also his best-ever film. Fully at the height of his large-format artistic powers, he crafts a towering and monumental achievement that is highly difficult to watch but continuously thrilling."

    },
    {
      "text": "Pugh is heartbreaking, but doesn't get to shine as much as Emily Blunt (as Oppenheimer's wife Kitty). Long-suffering thanks to her husband's obsessive career and dalliances, Blunt nonetheless provides needed steel for Bob in the final scenes."

    },
    {
      "text": "Nolan wallows in lazy, glib filmmaking, designed to turn the incineration of hundreds of thousands into a mellow, righteous glow of self-congratulation."
    },
    {
      "text": "That the director turned this most devastating of stories into a riveting pop culture phenomenon without ceding one inch on its tragic dimensions is surely an achievement for the ages."
    },

      "text": "I was uncomfortable watching yet another film about tortured white male genius when the victims of the atrocities glossed over by Oppenheimer had no voice."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nuclear noir spectator sports, a poison apple metaphorically intimating apocalyptic original sin, bombs, bombshells, and that buried Operation Paper Clip elephant in the room."

    },
    {
      "text": "The explosion of the test bomb is a bravura dance of imagery and sound, but also lack of sound. It’s an understanding of power without any of the essential characters in that moment knowing precisely what’s to come."

    },
    {
      "text": "[Christopher Nolan's] most stirring plea to humanity yet. A three-hour drama that plays like a terse thriller, weaving Nolan’s deep-seated fears for the survival of our species through a biography of one of its most significant and controversial figures."
    },
    {
      "text": "Armed with a haunting Cillian Murphy as J. Robert Oppenheimer, Christopher Nolan gives us his most personal and political film yet, that is fascinating as it is flawed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Oppenheimer is sombre and electrifying, dizzying and bloated, a contradiction that never quite comes together but at the same time is one of Nolan’s best and most political works to date."
    },
    {
      "text": "The true test of 'Oppenheimer' is whether Nolan can maintain his typically mammoth vision with a narrative that mostly comprises white men talking in small rooms. Like his protagonist, he succeeds in a grand and unexpectedly horrifying fashion."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though the entire ensemble operates as a well-oiled machine, it feels like distracting stunt casting at times."

      "text": "With human paradoxes at its nucleus, this is a riveting portrait, both intimate and epic, of the self-involved men who think they make the world go round... and too often, tragically, do."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cillian Murphy did a fantastic job with his portrayal of Dr. Oppenheimer! Not only did he resemble Dr. Oppenheimer, he was able to capture all of the fear and torment with his facial expression alone! Christopher Nolan truly brought filmmaking up a notch!"
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Oppenheimer\" is a stunner and one more way director Christopher Nolan reminds us cinema is a vital art form, not a disposable one."
    },
    {
      "text": "I find the last third of this movie to be interesting, and the first two-thirds to be long and, at times, not understandable."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a huge film, designed to be watched in IMAX (as I did) but it's actually a very intimate tale: arguably the first character study that Nolan has ever done."
    },
    {
      "text": "The three-hour running time and scientific jargon demand patience, but Nolan's marriage of visuals and sound design is often dazzling, not least during the tension-filled detonation of the prototype device."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thankfully, despite my qualms with Nolan purposefully structuring things to exploit our belief he's finally told a straightforward story, I was still completely taken by its gravitas. Give Murphy and Downey Jr. Oscars."
    },
    {
      "text": "The way the director approaches Oppenheimer's fears and his internal struggles with surrealistic images is the most admirable aspect of the film, and leaved us wanting to see more about it. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "OPPENHEIMER is Christopher Nolan's magnum opus. An engrossing epic that brings you inside the tortured mind of a man driven to change the world. Cillian Murphy is quietly stunning as the consumed Oppenheimer and RDJ delivers an Oscar worthy performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is very clear, effective, disciplined prestige filmmaking, enough to make this one of the toniest pieces of Oscarbait that I expect to see this year - but it is Oscarbait."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nolan refrains from passing judgment on Oppenheimer – leaving that to us, if we so choose – suggesting instead that it’s within our inherently contradictory human nature to create as well as destroy."
    },
    {
      "text": "The supporting cast are astonishing, particularly Downey Jr, who is on career best form as Strauss – his Best Supporting Actor nomination is surely already in the bag."
    },
    {
      "text": "This movie resembles a nightmare that torments not only the protagonist, but all of humanity. A horror that still lives and that finds a perfect representation in Cillian Murphy's haunted eyes. [Full review in Portuguese]"
    },
    {
      "text": "An intellectual thriller that is a masterpiece of image and word, of complex ideas made manifest, and all kept at a very human level to maintain constant immediacy."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the most stirring things about this excellently dense and jumpy biopic is that Nolan never tries to reconcile his subjects’ contradictions. If anything, he realises the futility of trying to know the unknowable. Who was J. Robert Oppenheimer?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The momentum the film generates due to the chronological cross-cutting becomes relentless, and that runaway feeling is beautifully harmonious with the film’s broader interest in Oppenheimer’s legacy."
    },
    {
      "text": "...a technically-impressive yet mostly underwhelming drama..."
    },
    {
      "text": "As emotional, beautiful, and thought-provoking as this film is, it’s that much more powerful because it’s based on historical events. It’s a film I won’t be able to shake for a long time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rarely have I left a movie feeling smarter than when I went in, but “Oppenheimer” is just such a film and it elevated my thinking, especially in regards to the science of politics and the politics of science."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film’s sheer density and a revolving door of characters make it heavy, but more often than not, Nolan’s filmmaking soars."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film’s speed – necessary to crunch decades of history into a condensed character study – is a bit like a trick in itself, both neglecting to let us dwell in a moment while emphasizing that Oppenheimer himself rarely did."
    },
    {
      "text": "Nolan and his entire crafts team have made something extraordinary. If the question is can a movie about a historical event be thrilling and suspenseful, Oppenheimer makes the answer a resounding \"yes.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "A majestic, mournful entertainment that’s as serious as a heart attack, Oppenheimer is Christopher Nolan’s bullseye shot at Grand Statement cinema that’s about nothing less than human annihilation."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a big, mammoth movie, boasting a career-best performance from Cillian Murphy, a whip-smart script, and other technical marvels. Jennifer Lame's editing is particularly remarkable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fortunately, it’s not treated like a dense physics course that can be overwhelming and difficult to understand. This film is one of Nolan’s best and searingly simple-yet-complicated works."
    },
    {
      "text": "A studious examination of history, shown via a reverent lens of Hollywood spectacle, Oppenheimer is a chilling biopic that could be Christopher Nolan’s best picture yet."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a complex look at a complicated man, but Oppenheimer unequivocally establishes that this is a story worth telling -- and that Nolan was the perfect filmmaker to do it."
    },
    {
      "text": "If Dunkirk, [Christopher Nolan's] 2017 film about the historic World War II battle, was his bid to prove that he’s a “serious filmmaker”, then Oppenheimer proves that he should be considered one of the modern masters of cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "Every scene feels like a cataclysm waiting to happen, fitting for a film that builds, step-by-step, to the creation of a cataclysm machine. Oppenheimer both summons awe for what it took to build the bomb and for the changes it wrought."
    },
    {
      "text": "A messy, sprawling, operatic statement from Nolan. It’s technically masterful, but can also keep you at a distance during crucial moments. But it’s also incredibly exciting to behold, a mosaic of intellectual cinema drenched onto the screen."
    },
    {
      "text": "On one side it’s an opportunity to get a history lesson on the matter, but the film only really shines on a few scattered powerful moments. It all came up more informative than fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "In a year that has given us several great films, this one shines above the rest and is the strongest contender for the Oscar so far in 2023."
    },
    {
      "text": "As he corrals the world’s scientists to follow behind him Robert Oppenheimer is magnetic, more akin to a cult leader than a lowly whitecoat."
    },
    {
      "text": "At three hours, Oppenheimer as a whole falls short of the sum of its pleasing parts."
    },
    {
      "text": "There’s one element worthy of unreserved praise here, and that’s Robert Downey Jr.’s welcome-home performance — his comeback, if you will, from his comeback, which kidnapped him into Marvel movies for eleven years"
    },
    {
      "text": "So much of our lives is about the fear and fearlessness around turning theory into action, at all levels of our lives. Oppenheimer is a run with those bulls, fearless and relentless."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite a few minor problems, Nolan has shown that with great patience comes great power. It may take some time but eventually Nolan shows his latest work is a blinding light of creativity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Oppenheimer is on the cusp of changing the world, mostly for the worst, but barely focuses on the moral quandary of this. All the Nolan beats but were missing the snarky Sorkin dialogue of A Few Good Men and smooth Tarantino style of Inglourious Basterds."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Nolan] captures that theoretical aspect of Oppenheimer on the screen in very personal moments... that energy, that swirl of passion in the unknown it's all there, and it is phenomenal to watch."
    },
    {
      "text": "If it does nothing else, this movie reminds us that the world still sits on the brink of global thermonuclear war, and international political and military leaders have repeatedly demonstrated they are no wiser today than world leaders were 78 years ago."
    },
    {
      "text": "Oppenheimer leaves you in tatters as it is a gripping piece on a man consumed by guilt and inner turmoil. “A man who became death, the destroyer of worlds.” You won't forget this film for a long time."
    },
    {
      "text": "This film is a White-Jewish male compartmentalized view of history that blinds us to the truth of the world that J. Robert Oppenheimer worked in."
    },
    {
      "text": "Christopher Nolan’s epic film bio/thriller is so gripping that you feel like you’re right there with Oppenheimer, anticipating the possible horrors his creation might unleash – never mind the horrors it did unleash."
    },
    {
      "text": "I am Nolan, saviour of cinema. Look upon my works, ye audiences, and despair. For what it is, it works, but it’s so boring when a man can demand so much to facilitate his achievement and still think he did it alone."
    },
    {
      "text": "The easy part for Christopher Nolan was making Oppenheimer a big-screen behemoth...trickier was embedding within that blockbuster a film of almost excruciating intimacy; a psychodrama that probes the soul of the 20th century’s most unknowable man."
    },
    {
      "text": "'Oppenheimer' is a masterpiece."
    },
    {
      "text": "The narrative of Oppenheimer's life certainly holds more than ample fascination for even a film with a three-hour runtime, and the story is treated comprehensively, with care and depth."
    },
    {
      "text": "Christopher Nolan’s newest film is jarring and memorable, an ode to creation and consequence."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Fascinating and frustrating, too close and aloof, this anti-biopic is a winning fusion of explosive paradoxes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not only does Oppenheimer prove to be one the best-crafted biopics in recent memory, but it also boldly reaffirms the director’s auteur status."
    },
    {
      "text": "After spending a decade-plus confined to the Iron Man suit and the Marvel playground, the man behind Lewis Strauss reminded everyone what he's capable of: a nervy performance full of pettiness, desperation, and force."
    },
    {
      "text": "The paradoxical thrill of Oppenheimer is that Nolan crafts an epic tale that’s intimate in nature—daring to go small when everyone is expecting a grand display of showmanship."
    },
    {
      "text": "Oppenheimer should have been called Oppie. And the shorting of the film's name should have been accompanied by an equally dramatic shorting of the film itself."
    },

      "text": "A rare film that deserves its hype, Oppenheimer stands tall as a biopic that presents complex and conflicting matters in a clearly understandable manner."

    {
      "text": "I was compelled throughout."
    },
    {
      "text": "Employing the stark angles of star Cillian Murphy’s expressive mien to great effect, Nolan gets into the head of the physicist, husband, father, womanizer, de facto politician, national hero, accused spy, and bomb-builder whose work changed the world."
    },
    {
      "text": "The visuals and technical aspects of Oppenheimer were always going to inspire praise, but it's Nolan's look at our frailty that sets this film in the upper echelon of an already famed filmography."

    },
    {
      "text": "“Oppenheimer” is sensationally filmed. The performances are mostly great, provided the role is a dude. It is easy to see why so many people are praising what’s here. But it is stealth stupid. It is sneaky simplistic. It is camouflaged dumb."
    },
    {
      "text": "Admittedly complicated and confusing, Christopher Nolan's non-linear bio-pic is intense, exacting and explosive. Expect Oscar nods for Nolan, Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr., who deliver the most indelible performances of their respective careers."
