    {
      "text": "The charisma and intensity of these actors tries visibly hard to render Extraction the raw urgency its mildly ambitious setting incessantly craves."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite its rather frustrating storytelling issues, Hargrave’s “Extraction” remains a compelling action thriller that continues to hold your attention throughout by its sheer kinetic power."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even as Extraction never falls for anything truly reprehensible, it muddles the big picture by allowing itself to be a pawn in politics that define an entire country for the worse."
    },

      "text": "In the end, Extraction is going to be remembered for its insane action and a fantastic lead performance by Chris Hemsworth."

      "text": "Ultimately unable to escape its genre roots... it is difficult not to enjoy a film where a man called Rake kills two men with a rake!"
    },
    {
      "text": "It doesn’t want to be character study or a think piece. It’s not interested in commentary or metaphors. Instead “Extraction” is a throwback to the better action movies of the late 80’s to mid-90s. It’s straightforward, unapologetic, and an absolute blast."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its fidgety two-hour runtime and the nonstop procession of gunfire and explosions, Extraction grows tedious, largely as a fault of the screenplay."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction never quite reaches the level of a great film. But, it is a film that channels the action films of yesteryear to provide much-needed quarantine entertainment for all cinephiles."

      "text": "The action is mostly clean and precise, a clear indication of Hargrave's foundation and the respect he has for what these stunt people do."

      "text": "Dumb, derivative and far too serious, Chris Hemsworth's latest is still a whole heap of fun..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction is one of those mostly brainless action movies that is best enjoyed for the intensity of its fight and chase scenes. If you can focus on those and not the story, you're in for a fun time."

      "text": "It's a brutal, pretty joyless action movie that aims to awe with visceral action. But once you get beyond all the bullets and mayhem, you quickly realise that the film doesn't have much else to offer."

    {
      "text": "This is for folks who like Rambo movies with a lot of carnage delivered by likable actors, which Hemsworth is."
    },
    {
      "text": "An incredibly fun, exciting and action-packed Blockbuster, which I really enjoyed! It's everything we were promised... and not much else. But for a film like this, not much else is really needed... switch your brain off and have some mindless fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "It all builds to a sacrificial finale that rips off \"Man on Fire\" with its bridge heroics and \"The Bourne Identity\" with an underwater plunge, only without the Moby soundtrack."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because almost all the main characters in the movie act like killing machines, there's almost a video-game quality to Extraction that's disappointing for a feature film that could have been better."
    },

      "text": "The film is bang on with its explosions, gunfights, hand-to-hand combats and chases, all lensed without taking the foot off the pedal. The rest is strictly middling."

    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction brings a ton of a well organized action scenes that will certainly keep audiences entertained from beginning to end. It has the ruthlessness of a Rambo film mixed with the exciting stunts of a John Wick movie. Unfortunately, that's about all..."
    },
    {
      "text": "For a couple of the year's most intense white-knuckle action sequences, action fans will find it worthwhile to overlook Extraction's glaring flaws."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction is flawed, especially when it comes to its ending feeling like an indecisive tease, but its extended and bloody action sequences are impressive enough to make Extraction a worthwhile action packed escape for any given evening."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's not much invention here. But the movie knows we've seen enough such films to fill in the blanks ourselves. Extraction is nothing but chassis, but it's sturdy enough to run."
    },
    {
      "text": "The action is what saves Extraction from being totally written off considering its story and characters are so generic - the screenplay from Joe Russo (Avengers: Endgame) does it no favours."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bloody, violent, preposterous movie. Chris Hemsworth is convincing even when the story isn't."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's all very kinetic eye candy, beautifully lensed with an array of saturated colors that capture the teeming population with steamy verve. But exhaustion eventually sets in."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction is worth watching for those who are action junkies, but for the casual viewer, it will probably leave something to be desired."
    },

      "text": "All told, Extraction is a reasonably entertaining, extreme action flick, although you can tell it is more cheaply made than a big-screen movie."

      "text": "Its priority is the action, and it does it well, delivering it with charisma and depth..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie loses points not just for its regressive outlook, but also for its underdeveloped plot, with a basic storyline so dull and predictable that it lacks excitement despite all the conflict."
    },
    {
      "text": "Pull out 'Extraction' for violent, fast-paced action."
    },
    {
      "text": "Head shot, body shot, Hemsworth sad, brown people bad, head shot, body shot. That's the rhythm of Extraction, and yes, it's also a white-savior narrative."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sad Angry Man is played by the largest Hemsworth, Chris. Part of the film's brutality is due to Hemsworth's stupidly massive proportions. If the lithe and nimble Keanu Reeves makes John Wick feel like murder ballet, Hemsworth's Extraction is Stomp."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction, while predictable and a tad overcooked, succeeds as a rousing action flick thanks to incredible set pieces and a strong performance from Chris Hemsworth."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bloody violence, trite story in predictable action tale."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a grimly entertaining viewing experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "The body count is off the scale, yet you may well find the cartoonish violence oddly lulling. I did."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has a twist that makes it a not so conventional film within the genre, which does not necessarily make it better, it is only a particularity that is appreciated. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The sheer orchestration of some of the action set pieces is really quite breathtaking."
    },
    {
      "text": "That slip of a setup... triggers breathtaking - and outlandish - action sequences, one of which is a dazzling 11-minute, sorta one-take spectacle... There's even an emotional payoff at the film's end."
    },
    {
      "text": "Far superior to Netflix's previous attempts at a big-budget action movie... it turns out that \"Extraction\" is precisely the testosterone-fueled pic we needed until our beloved movie theaters can reopen for business."
    },
    {
      "text": "Promises adrenaline and relentless action and that is exactly what it offers, in huge quantities. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "We can see everything from Hemsworth taking apart a room full of luckless goons, a running gun battle through the streets of Bangladesh, and a genuinely gripping car chase with a POV-perspective."
    },
    {
      "text": "Some of the best pure action choreography and cinematography of the past 10 years."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the end, after all that violence and ceaseless blokey shooting you might be left wondering whether another title might have been more appropriate: Exhaustion."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much of this feels like a film trying hard to be serious and cinematic, despite ending up as merely one of the better produced Netflix films to come along."

      "text": "You digest it like fast food; it's not particularly nutritious, but it does taste good. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The best thing Extraction has going for it is the camera work. It's just fantastic... The action is well executed and clear. I never found myself wondering what was happening to hammerless Thor, who was shooting at him or who he was shooting at."
    },
    {
      "text": "A solid, B-grade action thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "The difference is in the dizzying and powerful direction of Sam Hargrave. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "In a way, it's got the thrill to match, but not much on the substance. It's a shame there's no joy in its characters and story to really give the action something to thrive on."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you need a break from the news and from the urge to be anywhere but your house, Extraction might just be the distraction you need."
    },
    {
      "text": "In Extraction, Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary named Tyler Rake who winds up literally killing someone with a gardening rake. So, it's that kind of movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "The jewel in the crown of all the masterfully orchestrated mayhem is a brilliantly conceived set piece that combines fire fights, fist fights, car chases, foot chases and even falls from buildings into a continuous 12-minute sequence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Sam Hargrave and writer Joe Russo don't seem very interested in the personal histories of these people. The characters are paper-thin."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction offers irrefutable evidence of the fact that there's no point being dumb if you refuse to be smart."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction is bold not only for the way it tells its story but the medium in which it has chosen to tell it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction has the look and swagger of higher calibre action-thrillers but lacks their soul."
    },
    {
      "text": "From the moment Hemsworth takes out a room of short-if-cocky kidnappers - he is at least a foot taller than most of them - in the most brutal style, it grabs and does not let go. Visceral, breathless, wince-worthy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Chris Hemsworth shines in this dumb as bricks slice of escapism that makes John Wick's action look PG by comparison."
    },
    {
      "text": "That's a lot of serious talent behind this Netflix Original and by and large they pull it off. It's Jaiswal's performance, though, and the subcontinental setting, that lift it beyond the average shoot-'em-up thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "...it's not clear what Extraction is trying to earn, except more subscribers and bigger bonuses for its streaming service executives."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a shame this real crowd-pleaser won't be playing to crowds, but it still works as a Friday night, pop-the-popcorn, living room entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "I need my action movies to have ACTION. Extraction is cinematic cardio."
    },
    {
      "text": "...for what it is, right now, in these lockdown times, it does what it needs to: where the good guy, even if he is a white first-worlder saving the slummy third world, one bullet at a time, comes out on top..."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Extraction\" gives Chris Hemsworth another kind of heroic role and he lives up to every requirement. This movie is action packed and then some."
    },
    {
      "text": "Chris Hemsworth's new action vehicle packs up some pretty decent action sequences, but it could have taken benefit from a little originality script wise."
    },
    {
      "text": "By now, aren't we past something like 'Extraction?' The exemplary action doesn't distract from the utter brainlessness and soullessness of the entire endeavor."
    },
    {
      "text": "I've seen workout videos that had more interesting dialogue."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hargrave's action direction is solid and clean, and there's one absolutely superlative moment... where the director attempts to outdo Atomic Blonde's insane single-shot fight/chase and manages to come reasonably close to doing so."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction's visual and narrative flourishes and Hemsworth's charisma make for an enjoyable rollercoaster ride."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hemsworth might just be better at playing characters that share his natural droll charm and smirking sense of mischief. In Extraction, he often looks like he's the one who wants to be rescued."

      "text": "In the end it's the action we will end up remembering. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "It's a very polished action movie with few tropes and plenty of conflicts."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Extraction\" is effective and more than a little exhausting, but in a way, the smaller scale helps."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel colour grades using a thick sunset orange, apparently believing that evoking the qualities of dusk and creating moody atmosphere are the same thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Who are we rooting for in this accidental parody of the empty absurdity of modern action films? Everyone is awful, or a human macguffin. This is soulless technical wankery bereft of humor or humanity."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is a slight success. Just be prepared for buckets of blood and relatively little substance."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the stunt work were mediocre, the entire thing would be an utter waste of time. Thankfully though, Extraction boasts an exhaustingly awesome showcase of expertly choreographed fists, knives, guns, and explosions."
    },

      "text": "There's actually a really nice, emotional story."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "This movie was a lot better than I expected it to be."
    },
    {
      "text": "The one big weapon it has - Hemsworth's ability to juxtapose his brawn with approachable charm - is one it never pulls from its holster."
    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction has some of the best action sequences you can watch right now, and that alone makes it worth the watch."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first 45 minutes of \"Extraction\" are exhilarating; then we dip into the cat and mouse, backstory and snaky sub-agendas. It saps the energy some, but \"Extraction\" comes back with a flourish."

      "text": "Chris Hemsworth gives John Wick a run for his money in the body count department."

      "text": "In the end, Extraction is a solid film if you're looking for action, but falls flat in terms of both character, premise, and performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "It says a lot that the most interesting thing about Extraction is its end credits, which clock in at a staggering 14 minutes. Coincidentally, it's also about 14 minutes into the film that you'll start to lose interest."
    },

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Extraction is a lackluster and forgettable affair, despite some exciting moments. But then again, most modern war movies are exactly that. Chris Hemsworth is in a movie where stuff blows up and it's free. We're all going to watch it."
