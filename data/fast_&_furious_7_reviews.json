    },

      "text": "The crowd cheers. Vin Diesel glowers. At almost 2 1/2 hours it isn't exactly fast, but it's as furious as hell."
    },
    {
      "text": "The fact that Furious 7 is messier than any of the past installments is more than mitigated by its grandeur. \"Dom, cars don't fly! Cars don't fly!\" Brian yells before its biggest stunt. Furious 7 makes you believe they can."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "The actors are completely secondary. The hoops they jump through to get to the next action scene are just that. The expositional dialogue [starts] only after the action scene has, because they know we don't care why they're there: We're already with them."

      "text": "Outlandish as it all is, the movie delivers the goods."
    },
    {
      "text": "After cars have been smashed and big-ticket weaponry unleashed, it is really about family, friendship and loss."

    },

    {
      "text": "To really enjoy these films, it is important to understand that at their core, they are comedies."
    },
    {
      "text": "A big, noisy, ridiculously diverting time, that not only gives a proper sendoff to the character of Brian O' Conner, but manages to be a whole lot of fun in the process."
    },
    {
      "text": "The action scenes are ridiculous and implausible, but they are undeniably entertaining. Everything else, though, is drudgery."
    },
    {
      "text": "Has a heightened sense of mortality giving the series stakes for once, born of tragic circumstances due to the passing of Paul Walker, handled deftly by director James Wan"
    },
    {
      "text": "Operating with the same adolescent, bacchanalian glee of a comic book... Furious 7 thrusts the series to new heights of intensity, emotion, and head-shaking absurdity."
    },
    {
      "text": "If this episode is a little less coherent than the previous two, it's still very much a Fast and Furious movie, which means it's two tons of fun."

    },
    {
      "text": "The touching tribute to Walker puts the entire series into perspective and will make many eyes teary. The film's flaws suddenly vanish when you realise that if there is another film in this series, it just wouldn't be the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "Every time Wan tries to push the emotional envelope with Lettie (Michelle Rodriguez) and Dominic, the ride loses its punch."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though many scratched their heads when Aussie filmmaker, James Wan, was tapped to replace the departing Justin Lin in the director's chair, he proves to be a perfect fit."

    },
    {
      "text": "Put simply and bluntly, Fast & Furious 7 is great, thrilling, balls-to-the-wall entertainment. It's not only, and easily, the best in the F&F series, it's one of the best car operas you're ever likely to see."
    },
    {
      "text": "Paul Walker's action scenes excite without feeling exploitative and the finale saves it. The bummer is that \"Furious Seven\" needs saving, as too much of it feels more like joyless, obligatory and bereaved due diligence than a fist-pumping thrill."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's pretty great. Or at least, it's pretty much exactly the movie it should be, even with all its lumps and missteps."
    },

    },

    },
    {

    },

      "text": "The film ends on a sentimental note with a tear-jerking tribute to the late Paul Walker. The audience applauded at the end. I did too. Many of us sat through the credits hoping to see a Fast 8 teaser. There isn't one. None of us want this series to end."
    },
