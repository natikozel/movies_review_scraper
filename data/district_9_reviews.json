    {
      "text": "Part found footage (or just footage), part mockumentary, part satire and part action; Blomkamp pulls it into a coherent, moving, violent, sci fi allegory. Copley is terrific as Wikus moving from species-ist opportunist to a genuine if gormless redemption."

    },
    {
      "text": "In using recent political history as the subtext for his story, Blomkamp is following in a long science-fiction tradition: illustrating mankind's persistent stupidity, even after we have supposed learned lessons."

      "text": "Part alien invasion flick, part social commentary, Neill Blomkamp's chilling, thrilling \"District 9\" is a wholly original work. And it features a star-making turn from Sharlto Copley."
