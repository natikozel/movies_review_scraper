    },
    {
      "text": "Hereditary pushes the horror genre to a different extreme than the one we're used to, reminding us of the immense gulf between mere \"scary\" and \"horrifying\", and the result is like nothing you've ever seen."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "There's a lot going on and a lot that's been used before in \"Hereditary\". Ari Aster pushes scenes as far as they can possibly go. Yet it works. Toni Collette is its heart; she's superlative, her face moving from utter terror to delight to pure evil joy."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's that patient, character-driven, tension-building, psychological horror that firmly plants itself into your mind, and just refuses to let go."
    },
    {
      "text": "Be warned, this slow-burn film is seriously spooky. But expect prickling terror rather than jump-out-of-the-seat scares, although there is one sudden shock to make you gulp."

      "text": "Hereditary combines domestic drama and occult horror for a one-two punch that still has me knocked to the ground."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's pure aesthetic the whole way through, and, certainly, for the first 30-40 minutes the genuinely unsettling atmosphere is brilliantly sustained."
    },

      "text": "There are images in HEREDITARY that cannot go unseen, but humanity is discovered in the awful truths that unravel."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hereditary arrives like a white-hot dagger driven directly into the base of the viewer's skull. It's not merely \"good\"; it's downright traumatic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hereditary is a kitchen-sink drama disguised as a horror film, employing the intensity of both genres to full effect."
    },
    {
      "text": "You really think Hereditary's bounty of symbolism will amount to something profound, until the third act when you realize it's abandoned all of its commentary for typical horror fare."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hereditary can be difficult to watch, but for those who are willing and able to take this ride, it is likely to offer hours of discussion among friends and maybe even a few nightmares of your own."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hereditary is a disturbing descent into madness that highlights all the best parts of the horror genre."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a film that pivots from quiet grief to sickening, nightmare-fuel imagery without ever losing an inch of ground-building tension."
    },
    {
      "text": "An outstandingly horrifying achievement from a debut filmmaker, Hereditary is a classic in the making, built on rock-solid, terrifying, atmospheric terror."

    },
    {

      "text": "A deeply unsettling and horrifically disturbing film which will haunt you for a lifetime."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "... an assured debut that folds in Shirley Jackson, Rosemary Woodhouse and, for its immersive creepiness, 'Seance on a Wet Afternoon' ... Collette fearlessly explores Annie's primal fears, at times contorting her face into hideous mask"
    },
    {
      "text": "Hereditary terrifies from its first unnerving moments to its bombastic, nerve-shredding finale. This is by far the most affecting and effective horror film of the year."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its trippy turn at first feels refreshing, then goofy: the fatalism and sense of doom underpinning the film are very hard to take as seriously."
    },
    {
      "text": "It touches on annihilating despair, and asks its cast to lower themselves into an emotional meat grinder in a way that the film, I say, does not earn."
    },
    {
      "text": "But it's also genuinely horrific in a way that so many supposed horror films are not."

    {
      "text": "I loved that this movie scared me without resorting to [jump scares]."
    },
    {
      "text": "It builds the elements really beautifully, it orchestrally builds. You're really watching a family drama also with horror elements, then they really elevate."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's so much happening that it's difficult to talk too much without full-on spoilers. Just know that the two-hour-plus runtime is airtight."

      "text": "Toni Collette spectacularly dominates the film in a pumped-up, emotionally overwrought, deranged performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an uneasy and visually well-crafted horror exploring our parental fears. It's also a film that, surprise, surprise, has split opinions among audiences and critics."

      "text": "[Hereditary] is a tense picture, but one I found ultimately unfulfilling."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Be warned, this is indeed a scary movie. Like the recent and much louder A Quiet Place, this is cinema designed to slowly assault your senses and make you look over your shoulder on your way home."
    },
    {
      "text": "Collette shines brightest... It's the type of rare performance which elevates and transcends the narrative beyond any of its familiarities or limitations -- and its exactly what makes Hereditary and all its disturbing intentions so powerful."
    },
    {
      "text": "This may be a psychological thriller, but Hereditary features some of the most unsettling imagery of the year that triggers stuff of nightmares."
    },
    {
      "text": "It would be a far cry to claim that Hereditary is perfect,... but as far as debut features go, it is damningly smart and expects more of its audience than is necessary in a market swarmed with uninspired franchise films."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hereditary draws on the tropes of many different horror genres, which the fully engaged cast manage to help pull off without it all becoming too confusing."

    },
    {
      "text": "As it builds to a climax, the film takes a wild turn into hell with a bombast that seems unnecessary and undermining. Some viewers may be juiced by something this over-the-top, but I prefer the darker subtlety of a more quiet place."
