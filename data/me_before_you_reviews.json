      "text": "Bittersweet tearjerker, wallowing in the throes of simplistic melodrama."

    },
    {
      "text": "\"Me Before You\" is a feast for the eyes, whether our doomed lovers are vacationing in Mauritius or trading banalities in Will's castle quarters. But it's the ugliness of the film's message that a life without limbs is not worth living that galls you."

      "text": "I find it astounding that I actually like a film that should have triggered a gag reflex in me."
    },
    {
      "text": "Clarke and Claflin shine in this mostly enjoyable tearjerker, though the filmmakers leave many of the story's most interesting themes and ideas largely unexplored."
    },
    {
      "text": "While the film itself is pretty bearable in parts -- Claflin and Clarke are good, and work well together -- it's all rather pat and manufactured."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are plenty of 'inspirational' speeches and cloying montages, but no real depth or drama. It's also a tad offensive in its handling of the subject of euthanasia and, um, let's be honest, some of the dialogue is unintentionally hilarious."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yet thanks to its two leads, it is a film that should score with its intended audience even if it doesn't get much respect."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fans of the best-selling novel by Jojo Moyes will be heartened to hear that she wrote the screenplay, too, and that she has preserved all the lines that - when read aloud - will provide much mirth at your next dinner party."

    {
      "text": "Me Before You's reliance on formula prevents it from being as compelling as it could have been."
    },
    {
      "text": "Such a wonderfully uncynical movie that it almost doesn't matter that it isn't very good."
    },
    {
      "text": "Claflin plays it straight, and Clarke comes to be the strength of Me Before You, which will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and you'll probably be better for having done both."
    },
    {
      "text": "Me Before You is so much more enjoyable than it could have -- and probably should have -- been. Amid the patronizing writing and perfectly timed Ed Sheeran songs are some truly entertaining moments between the leads."
    },
    {
      "text": "With the author as screenwriter and a couldn't-be-better teaming of its photogenic star-crossed pair, MB4U should be a bit more polished than it is."

      "text": "It's not perfect - there are times when the pacing is off and the epilogue tries too hard to end things on a positive note - but it's effective and affecting."
    },

      "text": "The only real acting in this movie comes from Janet McTeer and Charles Dance as Will's aggrieved parents. They bring some ballast to this blubberfest."

    },

    },
    {
