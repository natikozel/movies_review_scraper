    },
    {
      "text": "Silence continues to be golden with this horror franchise. The sequel is filled with all the breath-holding tension that made the original so intensely scary."
    },
    {
      "text": "Quiet Place Part II depicts quietness as a strength, and the film’s release shows that the quietness of the past year can be resolved through the mutable, powerful sensibilities of cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the best sequels ever created. Fascinating world building, amazing performances, & truthfully one of the best first acts I’ve experienced in awhile. It starts & never stops for a moment building on each & every scene"
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II feels less than its predecessor in almost every element, but it's still one of the best sequels of the genre. Cillian Murphy and Emily Blunt are remarkable, but Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds are astonishing,"
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place II has some of the most beautiful stories to tell. It’s a love letter to the next generation. A love letter to understanding people and families and especially children."

      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II isn’t always as quiet as the title or the first film might suggest, but the more silent moments are the most impactful."

    {
      "text": "John Krasinski crafts a masterclass in suspense with Hitchcockian anxiety that would make the master proud."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II doubles down on what made its predecessor so popular, delivering another ridiculously riveting feat of horror filmmaking from John Krasinski."
    },
    {
      "text": "The impeccable mix of camerawork, sound design, and editing create the kind of nail-biting tension that will run throughout the film’s taut 97-minute runtime."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first film in the series was so fresh, standing out in that year's box office. This film isn't better or cleverer, it's just a continuation of the things we loved in the first film, which isn't bad at all."
    },
    {
      "text": "What makes it a worthy follow-up is the same precise use and disuse of sound. The boundary between the screen and the audience disappears in the silence."

    {
      "text": "An older and wiser sequel with thematic restraint."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part 2 proves that there's still enough thrills in this concept to yell about."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II, like all sequels, battles to convince you that it was made for a reason other than the first one making a lot of money. It mostly succeeds, bringing the thrills and tension expected with the name, even if some depth is sacrificed."
    },
    {
      "text": "A QUIET PLACE PART II is a good and consistent sequel, but I would have hoped for a bit more innovation and brutality. It is exciting and emotional again, but its trick is already well known by now."

    {
      "text": "This is a great horror movie that focuses on building dread through a sheer feeling of terror and suspense over grisly violence, blood, and gore."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an entertaining follow-up to the 2018 original."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II takes all the pieces needed to be a truly great horror sequel and ties them together with a flimsy and disappointing execution, that does the entire project a disservice."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the miracles of the Quiet Place franchise is how Krasinski gets audiences to sit silent for 97 minutes. A Quiet Place Part II is an intense, hair-raising edge-of-your-seat thriller that wonderfully lures filmgoers back to the theaters."
    },
    {
      "text": "It doesn't lose what made the original fresh and surprising-that's all we can ask any sequel to do, right?"
    },
    {
      "text": "Simmonds elicits a performance that is as compelling as it is emotionally raw, and her scenes with the well-cast Murphy give the movie the gravity it needed to hold our attention the second time around."
    },
    {
      "text": "The follow-up to Krasinski's brilliant first film finds him doing the near impossible. It's a successful prequel and sequel which ends with the all-but-promise of a third outing without caving into any kind of commercial demands or narrative check-lists."
    },
    {
      "text": "Quite the nail-biting, twisted and terrific thriller that will keep you on the edge of the seat as much as the first one."

    },

      "text": "John Krasinski takes all the juice out of his visual storytelling, connecting with all the characters even with them not being in the same space. An incredible sequel that shocks more because of its genre. [Full review in Spanish]"

    {
      "text": "Despite it still being a very respectable and effective sequel, it does raise the question of how much fuel is left in the tank?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The premise begins to strain some already thinly spread credulity, but Millicent Simmonds is a complete star."
    },
    {
      "text": "As you get wrapped up in the frenetic action inside the film's compact, 97-minute structure, you'll admire the thrill ride that The Quiet Place Part II is taking you on.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place: Part II brilliantly teases out the first film's premise, Murphy is very good as the dead-eyed survivor, Emmett, and Simmonds once again steals the show as the endlessly resourceful Regan."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II is excruciatingly tense at times and pushes a series of devilish little buttons along the way just to make extra sure we're paying attention."
    },
    {
      "text": "I enjoyed the movie, but it does play more so... like a really good episode of a television show than a full-on movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Emily Blunt does an exceptional job in a movie that ends a bit too soon - before it can get started in answering my unaddressed questions or do enough exploring"
    },
    {
      "text": "Lives up to its predecessor. Successfully expands on this world introducing new characters that add to the complexity of this environment. Superb sound design and stellar performances by the children make it worthwhile."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's plenty to admire about this intelligent and engrossing follow-up."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's grim and stressful and relentless, but comes off even more hollow than the first film."
    },
    {
      "text": "A solid continuation of the first film that allows Millicent Simmonds and Noah Jupe to step into expanded roles. Cillian Murphy is an excellent surrogate father figure and the more playful, experimental sound design delivers new scares."
    },
    {
      "text": "While this sequel sacrifices some of its full-blooded fear factor for spectacle, the movie knows exactly how to go bump in the night -- and, crucially, in the light of day."

    },
    {
      "text": "John Krasinski ratchets up the tension to almost unbearable levels in A Quiet Place Part II, a sequel that doesn't disappoint thanks to its stellar cast, more big scares, and a story that feels earned after that excellent first movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tense and surprising, John Krasinski delivers a sequel that more than lives up to the standards set by its predecessor."
    },
    {
      "text": "You're reminded of all this family lost and how resilient they always were during a pulse-pounding action sequence. He's really quite a good action/thriller director."

    {
      "text": "This thriller is filled with precision-tooled suspense even if it doesn't expand on the 2018 original as much as it could."
    },
    {
      "text": "The perfect example of a film which was made to be seen in a movie theatre is A Quiet Place Part II."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II does everything a proper sequel is supposed to do: continue the original arc, expand its universe and broaden the character's boundaries. A third installment seems almost inevitable at this point... and something to wait for indeed."
    },
    {
      "text": "'A Quiet Place II' is a horror sci-fi movie to shout about."

    },
    {
      "text": "The real treat of \"Part II,\" however, is in watching Millicent Simmonds as Regan."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it doesn't hit the levels of the first for me, A Quiet Place Part II still has so much to love as we watch these characters overcome their grief in a world that doesn't allow the luxury to wallow in it"
    },
    {
      "text": "There's nothing like the big screen for a fun ride like this, and the Abbots won't be the only ones holding their breath."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II is a rollicking good time... it's all part of an exceedingly well-constructed mild horror film... with thrills galore. If this doesn't get people back to the movies, I'm not sure what will."
    },
    {
      "text": "For all of its big and brilliant sequences of suspense and monster scares, the film feels a little less emotionally investing and interesting than its predecessor."
    },
    {
      "text": "Unlike many other horror films, where people are ultimately only a means to an end, here you really get the feeling that you're dealing with real people... the film doesn't shy away from showing the ugly sides of human nature. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the most overtly Spielberg-ian exercise to hit the big screen since Super 8. ... Krasinksi proves he's learned a lot from the master of adventure and suspense."
    },
    {
      "text": "A great companion to the original film. It has all the thrills and emotions of the original while exploring the world more and introducing more characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski doesn't mess too much with the formula that made the first \"A Quiet Place\" so chillingly effective."
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski's instincts are very good, and once you've placed the primary action there...then it allows the story to move forward, maintain and even build on the tension of the original."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bigger, more ambitious and spectacular than the original... but it never betrays the elements that made it a terrifying experience with heart. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski has given us characters we feel like we know and care about. He doesn't just rely on shock value to entertain audiences, he's created an effective horror with a compelling premise that pushes the story forward."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ultimately, it's the younger players who make all the difference here."
    },
    {
      "text": "While the first one was about the unease of bringing children into this dangerous and unpredictable world, \"Part II\" is about the even greater unease of trusting those children to navigate that world on their own."
    },
    {
      "text": "The sequel to John Krasinski and Emily Blunt's horror-thriller A Quiet Place can't deliver the same surprises as the original. But it still works."
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski has on his side a gifted actress, Blunt (his wife in real life), whose job in the sequel is to convey terror and vulnerability. She excels in this regard."
    },
    {
      "text": "Suffers from sequel-itis. What was new in the first is old in the second."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tense and action-packed. It could be the end - but it leaves plenty of space to expand."
    },
    {
      "text": "This sequel can never feel as fresh or as groundbreaking as the original, but it lives up to the high bar set by its predecessor."

    },
    {
      "text": "Having been raised by a dad who modeled self-sacrificial love and courage, Regan [and Marcus] both demonstrate these characteristics in the film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Taking out the fact that it's in the horror genre, it's just a good, well-made movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "The biggest asset of this second chapter is Simmonds -- the young actress telegraphs a striking combination of determination and fear like nobody else, carrying a movie at the ripe age of 18 alongside heavyweights such as Murphy and Blunt."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II is still an effectively tense, scary sci-fi/horror mash-up, and, as theaters are reopening, a great film to experience with a crowd."
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski succeeds not in expanding the mythology of the monsters, but in continuing to focus entirely on family dynamics. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "A Quiet Place 2 is perfect for terrifying escapism. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "This is what a director hitting a long home run with a vicious bat flip looks like on film. A sequel with monstrous expectations is just as sharp as the brilliant original."
    },
    {
      "text": "Trusting the audience enough to spend more time on showing rather than telling, A Quiet Place Part II truly is a masterclass of visual story telling, made possible by its talented and committed cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "Featuring some stupendous parallel editing and killer jolts, A Quiet Place Part II is a fine film to herald the full-scale return to cinemas."
    },
    {
      "text": "[A Quiet Place Part II] ends up treading a very familiar and formulaic path. It is still a nerve-shredding thrill ride of course."
    },
    {
      "text": "I didn't appreciate viewing a child in agony then actual torture by dosing vodka on a wound. Poor and irresponsible choices were made here in writing."
    },
    {
      "text": "A remarkable sequel that rightly expands John Krasinski's terrifying universe. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "In a cast of heavyweights, Millicent Simmonds delivers another standout performance as her arc fuels the action."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part 2 is finally here, and it was well worth the wait. It's a powerful continuation of the original story that retains all the aspects that worked in its predecessor while exploring new themes and character development."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II feels more like an expansion pack than a full sequel, reusing assets to tell a brief epilogue that doesn't move the story forward very far."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a film that begins with the motherly advice to \"just breathe\" - and then does its damnedest to make sure you do the opposite for 90 minutes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Totally stupid but still fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "We get a taste of what we loved in A Quiet Place, and we also get a compelling new hook to hang the franchise on. That's a good way to make a sequel."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"More of the same\" has rarely been carried off with such elan."
    },

      "text": "Krasinski not only ups the tension but also continues to build a world that slowly reveals itself to the audience, surprise after surprise. {Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Top-notch film making; moves faster than its predecessor--a genre film so there's not a lot of meat on the bone, but the barbecue sauce is tangy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sound is used very carefully and precisely, and the range of high action and quiet tension play off one another very well indeed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director and co-writer John Krasinski certainly keeps tension levels and visual-effects standards high, but one plot revelation is borderline laughable."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is terrific, and really should be seen on the biggest screen possible."
    },
    {
      "text": "You get the sense that Krasinski faintly disapproves of the genre that has given him his biggest success, but the best bits are really genre thrills, their screws tightened."
    },
    {
      "text": "The characters ooze slowly and lethargically away from each other, and without that farmhouse location, and the symbolic power of the family it implies, the horror movie tension simply evaporates."
    },
    {
      "text": "You daren't look away from a film that passes in a flash, ending at the poiint A Quiet Place Part III begins."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's not much of a secret that these films aren't great, but given the state of the art, they're setting a relatively, welcomingly high standard."
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski's slick, skilful follow-up to his 2018 post-apocalyptic thriller works well as a genre exercise..."
    },
    {
      "text": "This film is a respectable sequel that knows how to settle in the pocket. Where it lacks in suspense, it makes up in writing and performances."
    },
    {
      "text": "Suspenseful sequel A Quiet Place: Part II advances the family survival tale on a greater scale, but with less intensity."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II will satisfy horror fans that are looking for the scares, while also giving us a heartfelt story about the lengths people will go to protect others from the unimaginable."
    },
    {
      "text": "The sequel is fine ditching a few logic points to raise the spectacle. It's not the ideal trade-off since the first showed it is capable to be smart and suspenseful."
    },
    {
      "text": "[T]he film's depiction of survivors dealing with the everyday drudgery and dread of an ongoing threat resonates in ways the filmmakers couldn't have anticipated."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it's not as fresh or surprising as the original, A Quiet Place Part II adeptly balances the demands of both the genre movie and the emotional impact of the family drama."
    },
    {
      "text": "I really like John K's structuring & jump scares, BUT (big BUT) the humans have all the conveniences, which makes the conclusion a bit foregone. If you liked the FIRST ONE ..."

      "text": "With only two directing credits under his belt, actor-turned-filmmaker John Krasinski has proven himself one of the brightest up-and-comers in cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's more of the same but it's still very effective. The only problem is an abrupt ending that doesn't wrap things up or set it up well for more."
    },
    {
      "text": "I still care about the family, it's still well done, it's well executed, the tension is still there."
    },
    {
      "text": "Now, it doesn't clear the high bar set by the first movie, whose surprising and innovative craftsmanship made it one of the best horror movies of recent years. But it does have plenty to offer."
    },
    {
      "text": "With Blunt, Jupe and, above all, Simmonds all doing sterling acting work, A Quiet Place Part II remains a superior horror movie. Do go. Just don't bring any popcorn."
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski manages to coax out more tension and thrills from his new sequel, even through the curtain was fully pulled back on the lurking evil in the first film. It's not as fresh, but still entertaining."
    },
    {
      "text": "The perfect summer popcorn movie, not in the sense that you need to check your brain at the door, but this is a movie about sensation, not inner contemplation, and it's a bracing, entertaining example of the form"
    },
    {
      "text": "QP2 is not the kind of sequel that lingers in the mind afterward, but it's good enough to make getting back to the movie theaters seem worth getting off the couch for."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a testament to the quality of actors like Blunt and a new survivor played by Cillian Murphy that anyone would care, what with their emotional range trapped somewhere between determined and very determined."
    },
    {
      "text": "Krasinski's direction is assured and inventive, avoiding cheap scares while cleverly using depth of focus and a vivid sound mix to put the audience into the characters' shoes."

      "text": "Part II is just as taut and lean as its predecessor."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you liked A Quiet Place, you should expect to enjoy more of the same in its sequel, given how closely it hews to the original formula."
    },
    {
      "text": "Maybe nothing could have possibly matched the original for me. [But] everyone is very good in it. The kids, Noah Jupe and Millicent Simmonds, really are the stars here."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like in the first film, Krasinski has a greatly assured sense of direction. He brings terrific performances out of his cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "The new film has inevitably lost the concision of the last, in the same way the minimalist frights of Alien were swapped for the wham-bam action of Aliens... In other instances, though, the stakes have been raised."
    },
    {
      "text": "When A Quiet Place Part II works, it really works. But, overall, it fails to live up to the expectations and high standards that the first movie has established."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not nearly as enthralling as the original, the director lazily copies and pastes..."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you haven't been unsettled enough in the past year, A Quiet Place Part II is just the thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Going from world building to world exploring, Part II experiments less with genre to bring about a noticeably different experience - one with a lot more sound and a lot less story...[but] there's a good apocalypse story here."
    },
    {
      "text": "Who says we need Christopher Nolan and his twisty turny theatrics to save cinema when John Krasinski barely requires dialogue to get the job done."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's hard to begrudge A Quiet Place Part II much... Clocking in at a brisk 97 minutes, it's a lean-and-mean thriller with a lot of heart, even though it's a bit thin."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a decently mounted, handsome-looking effort that squanders the considerable potential it arrives with."
    },
    {
      "text": "Blunt makes messy braids and dirty bare feet look apocalyptic chic."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an interesting thread for A Quiet Place to pull on, but also in many ways a necessary one: You can watch the heroes quietly evade hypersensitive aliens only so many times before the \"don't make a sound\" novelty wears thin."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II is not without its problems, but John Krasinski has crafted a genuinely scary, emotionally satisfying follow-up to one of the best horror films of the past few years."
    },
    {
      "text": "I felt some of the more suspenseful moments but I wish I could tell you that in its fleet 97 minutes, Part II approached the surprise level of the original...feels more like an encore than a great sequel."

      "text": "Krasinski's sequel chills as a suspense-filled survival drama..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The world of the original is expanded, there's a bit more noise and the jump scares are just as effective... This chapter manages to still keep interest peaked."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it is certainly thrilling for its duration, what you see - or hear - is what you get. For here, as in A Quiet Place, viewers will find little subtext to keep ringing and resonating in their ears afterwards."
    },
    {
      "text": "As he did the first time around, Krasinski shows a gift for directing this type of fare, producing several scenes that pull you in and almost refuse to let you breathe."
    },
    {
      "text": "Millicent Simmonds delivers a pivotal performance in this subtly suspenseful sequel, opening the door for yet another installment."
    },

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "More crucially, Part II earns the promise of a sequel by doing what the best sequels do, striking out in search of new stories instead of settling for retracing its steps. Part II isn't A Quiet Place, but it's an addition worth applauding all the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "In a way, the sequel feels even more M. Night Shyamalan-esque, drawing out seemingly mundane sequences for maximum suspense as it does."

      "text": "The sci-fi survival horror sequel \"A Quiet Place Part II\" doesn't quite live up to the refreshing feel or innovative novelty of the original 2018 hit... but the creatures are still freaky, the soundscapes are still interesting..."

    {
      "text": "Part II stands as a careful consolidation and continuation of its parent film rather than a departure, with the heart and hope needed to keep us invested."

      "text": "A Quiet Place Part II is finely prepared leftovers, still tasty but with a faint staleness cutting into the flavor."
    },
    {
      "text": "What Krasinski has done is direct a solid post-apocalyptic adventure with some horror flair, which is totally fine, but it's a clear step down from the first film."
    },

      "text": "[Simmonds] mesmerizing presence sustains you through the unresolved final moments of \"A Quiet Place Part II,\" a viscerally effective endgame that nonetheless seems content to reiterate rather than build on its predecessor's revelations."
