      "text": "A careful reframing of the typical coming-of-age narrative, Spirited Away displays a fondness those infinitely awkward years, while showing us all how important they were in making us who we are today."
    },
    {
      "text": "As with every Miyazaki picture, Spirited Away wants to at once amaze and familiarize you with an impossible dream, but it remains unique within his oeuvre for cementing that narrative desire into the essential groundwork of the story."

    },
    {
      "text": "Visually, this is a magnificent example of Japanese animation. The story is another matter. At times, the shifting plot is almost too complex for explanation."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is an animated film of graphic splendor, with its realistic, often painterly backgrounds and characters who are as fanciful as the Wild Things of Maurice Sendak."

    },
    {
      "text": "All in all, Spirited Away is a better animated feature film than anything to come out of Disney in the last 50 years."

    },
    {
      "text": "The plot starts suffering from dèjá vu before it's even half over. There are only so many octopus men, stink spirits and pig people you can take before they all start to blend together."
    },
    {
      "text": "Backgrounds have been fashioned with the delicacy of fine water colors. But for all that, Spirited Away left me pretty cold. Emotionally it's remote; narratively it seems to always be circling and never landing."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although you must admire Miyazaki's imagination, you crave cohesion in his storytelling... Spirited Away was a smash in Japan, but something gets lost in the translation here."

      "text": "This one is an event, a huge accomplishment in the world of traditional animation and a powerful rebuttal to the notion that films for children must be simplistic and visually dull."
    },
    {
      "text": "Chihiro's escapades don't always proceed one from the other, but let yourself go and you'll be swept away as well."
    },
    {
      "text": "The impressive watercolour backgrounds and intense focus on the smallest details make Spirited Away more than a kid's flick. It will grab hold and impress, amaze and entertain before letting you go."

    },
    {
      "text": "Miyazaki conjures up monsters and magic that might scare the pants off impressionable kids from eight to eighty. Miyazaki is the Pied Piper -- see Spirited Away and you'll follow him anywhere."

    {
      "text": "...its visual style is remarkably beauteous and its creative touches abundantly imaginative."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much of what makes the film work lies in the combination of its small touches and emotionalism, making it something more than a film for people who like to get stoned and go watch freaky animation (though it almost certainly works on that level, too)."
