    {
      "text": "It would be easy, but superficial, to lump Call Me by Your Name as just a romance film between two young men, but director Luca Guadagnino thankfully has a lot more on his mind."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me by Your Name skips through time like a dream, or a calcified, powerful memory. Guadagnino succeeds remarkably in working the themes into the craft and, like love that ends too soon, so does the film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Luca Guadagnino’s lush Italian masterpiece, “Call Me by Your Name,” is full of romantic subtleties: long lingering looks, brief touches, meaning-laden passages read aloud. But nothing is ever fully overt..."

      "text": "From the 1980s idyllic Italian countryside to the slow-burn romance, Luca Guadagnino directs a mesmerizingly dreamy summer experience."

    },
    {
      "text": "While it's the simmering sexual tension that keeps you watching for most of the film, it's only later that you realise this is a character piece about a man's bluster and how his confidence does not make him strong."

      "text": "The most humane and kind movie in a year that featured so many others filled with anxiety and darkness."

    {
      "text": "Chalamet's performance is magnificent - this is the sort of performance that stretches across a lifetime. This is \"Hey look we have our own James Dean now\" level good stuff here"

      "text": "The blossoming romance between these two men, that unfurls over six sun-dappled weeks in northern Italy, is utterly ravishing."

    },
    {
      "text": "Guadagnino has absorbed some of that Merchant Ivory mojo, with its sotto vocce emotions and divine European languor. But he's also fallen victim to his inspiration's vices as well."

      "text": "Its refreshing to watch a movie which embraces the past without sacrificing the present."
    },
    {
      "text": "While making comparisons is nearly always reductive, Call Me By Your Name feels like Brokeback Mountain via Richard Linklater - which hopefully sounds like a compliment because it is meant as a huge one."

      "text": "I enjoyed the leisurely pace and the great writing by James Ivory."
    },
    {
      "text": "An utterly triumphant work of art."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name resembles the passionate love story it depicts in many ways. It's one of those breathtaking cinematic experiences which demands to be called a \"film\" rather than a \"movie.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "A stunning film - a sensual feast filled with desire."
    },
    {
      "text": "Guadagnino's film looks like idealized young love feels. It's as warm, lush, and timeless as a sacred Apollonian grove."
    },
    {
      "text": "Guadanigno is not interested in creating a story about sin, but rather one about joy, goodbyes and the loss that involves love. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name is a masterfully told story about first love, hidden sexual desire and coming-of-age experiences capped with great performances, immersive production values and nuanced direction that will surely dazzle the eyes and warm your heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "Guadagnino creates a perfectly judged atmosphere of melancholy, longing, tranquillity and inner turmoil as the heat of the summer engulfs Elio with a rising attraction to Oliver."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's charming, it's pleasing, it's a bit sexy, it takes apricots to places they've never been before - but it's a strong movie with wonderful messages, subtexts and delivery."
    },
    {
      "text": "A stunning coming-of-age tale that will go down in gay cinema history."
    },
    {
      "text": "By the end of the film, when Michael Stuhlbarg delivers what is surely one of modern cinema's most achingly beautiful monologues, I was a puddle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Guadagnino delivers one of the year's most striking, eloquent films... Each moment feels pulled out of a different era, transporting viewers in a way only cinema masters can."
    },
    {
      "text": "Gorgeous to look at but with a barebones plot that struggles to keep things chipping along and some questionable statutory dilemmas, I found myself hovering on the edge of attention when I should have been diving in head first."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name has been marketed as a gay romance, yet less overt is its inclusion of Jewish culture."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name is an unapologetic celebration of emotion."
    },
    {
      "text": "An observational character piece that's meant to be experienced in terms of visual beauty, erotic charge and thoughtful contemplation on the intensity and brevity of youth and love."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a very astute study of the struggles of a young man trying to find out who he is and struggling between relationships -- both conventional and forbidden by society."
    },
    {
      "text": "Here is a film that shuns conventions expected in coming-of-age stories and romances but never at the expense of universal emotions felt by anyone who has ever been in love."
    },
    {
      "text": "Guadagnino's adaptation of André Aciman's novel is a wonderfully sensitive and evocative portrait of young love, but lost in time somewhere in Northern Italy, Call Me By Your Name gets caught up in the outdated politics of its day."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name is a staggeringly beautiful film that brings together a fully fleshed out artistic vision ... as well as a host of brilliant performances from its cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "Where so many Hollywood \"gay\" stories end on positive notes of rebirth and optimism, Guadagnino helms a love story unafraid to highlight the suffering one always contains."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name survives because of poignant screenwriting, keen directing, and tender acting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Right when I begin to feel fatigued by \"coming of age\" movies, this comes out and blows me away."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name doesn't insist on your attention for much of its two-hour running length; it lets you fall in and out, its scenes glazed with a nostalgia that almost encourages personal reminisces."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name is a romantic masterpiece and, quite possibly, my favourite film of the year."
    },
    {
      "text": "In one singular space, you feel insecure, confident, charismatic, inferior and completely clueless, as if it were a revolving door never allowing you to stop and walk through, towards something bigger, maybe even something grown up."
    },
    {
      "text": "A compelling, confusing, beautiful film peopled with unforgettable, believable characters, not necessarily a crowd pleaser, but an intense, highly individual vision that might open your eyes to what the definition of \"summer romance\" can mean."
    },
    {
      "text": "By opting against a graphic depiction of the characters' carnal consummation, it causes that spark of first love Elio is coming to terms with to linger more pervasively. That warmth exuding from the screen is \"Call Me by Your Name's\" gift to you."
    },
    {
      "text": "I find it strangely hypocritical that Hollywood is so willing to celebrate the behavior on film that it so vehemently condemns in real life... Call Me By Your Name is creepy, not cool."
    },
    {
      "text": "It works well as a coming of age story and examination of how people communicate when they are unsure of the other's feelings."
    },
    {
      "text": "Chalamet's performance ascends into the pantheon of greats, a mixture of Marlon Brando's brimming panic and Heath Ledger's simmering vulnerability."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me by Your Name is a stronger film than the director's last film, A Bigger Splash, and employs touches of pure emotion that will tug at your heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "Oliver being a whole person instead of a dreamboat would have elevated this movie to the first rank. But go see this movie, bask in the sunshine and feel your heart growing three sizes larger."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is much to relish in this passionate, visually rich romance...that particularly excels in its refreshing take on the permissiveness that's possible through liberalism guided by knowledge and experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "The era of LGBT cinema has reached a zenith with this film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Surprisingly, given how hyper-articulate everyone is, the duo's most potent scenes are wordless, conveying a wealth of emotion in glances and gestures."
    },
    {
      "text": "In a technical sense, Guadagnino understands how to transition between these moments, allowing the film to breathe effortlessly into the next as scenes are woven together with cross dissolves and fades rather than harsh cuts."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is the transmission of halcyon and the ensuing tragedy of its evaporation that Guadagnino nails in his adaptation."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is a preciseness in the performances in Luca Guadagnino's Call Me By Your Name that is not just enchanting but also essential in turning the gentle romance into something substantial and profound."
    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me by Your Name's strength is that it really does seem like the character played by Timothée Chalamet made the film himself."
    },
    {
      "text": "The chemistry between the leading men grows organically and it chronologically makes sense for the viewer. These characters take time to feel comfortable with each other and the film takes its time documenting it."
    },
    {
      "text": "The characters' beauty and intellectual perfection is so consummate that I couldn't entirely believe that these people actually had genitals-that they could ever sweat or incur sunburn."

    },
    {
      "text": "Call Me By Your Name does more harm than good, and needed to be and do more. Especially as yet another queer white cisgender-centric film, it should have aimed for the stars instead of aiming to make people feel comfortable."

    },
    {
      "text": "I appreciated the film quality and the acting but the story meandered in superficial courtship for too long without delivering actual connection. It was all foreplay and no action. Perhaps the sequel will make this film more appealing to me in the future."

    {
      "text": "A sweet and loving film where the characters are less mindful of an outside response and more consumed by the amorous temptations they possess."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anyone who has experienced the flush of first love will relate, but the fact that the film is specific and detailed both emotionally and physically in its portrayal of a gay relationship makes it a standout."

    },
    {
      "text": "There's no way to convey why I dislike the film so much without giving out major spoilers later in this review, so be warned if you're really dying to see this 132-minute, morally bankrupt snoozefest."

    {
      "text": "\"Call Me By Your Name\" can be considered an idealistic film, but that's only natural for something about young people experiencing something wonderful for the first time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Some of the scenery in the film, including a waterfall, is spectacular. The location shots are sumptuous. The acting is subtle and moving. This film has a lot going for it, but it is also very low-key, relatively non-dramatic and slow-moving."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an extraordinary thing for a narrative film to successfully observe its characters like they aren't of its own creation - to make them utterly alive in front of us."
