    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi is not only the best film in the Sequel Trilogy by far, but it’s a very natural, very fitting way to continue the story that started with The Force Awakens."
    },
    {
      "text": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi delivers something that I can be proud of experiencing. Rian Johnson takes a lot of risks with decisions that will make the fanbase debate for years and while I find most of them truly jaw-dropping, a few left me underwhelmed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi is an emotionally-driven culmination of all that came before it and an adoring love letter to George Lucas."

      "text": "As a sensational Star Wars vehicle and a pensive reminder of ideals for any age, The Last Jedi holds its lightsaber high - a beacon for what these films can be, and what they can impart."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rian Johnson brings freshness and originality..."
    },
    {
      "text": "As much into de-mythologizing the Force as it is relishing in its fantastic fight choreography and intergalactic dogfights."

    {
      "text": "The Director and The Jedi is long on time but has enough sentiment to satisfy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Not all its risks pay off, but its biggest wins outdo anything in the previous film. For fans, there are many, many moments that will leave you cheering or weeping, possibly both at once."

    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi doesn't entirely detach from the mythological themes and fantasy tropes Lucas' movies played with - but it feels like the start of a brave new world."

      "text": "A film that will make you want to watch it again and again and again."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Star Wars universe is vast with so many potential stories to tell. The Last Jedi met my expectations because it was an attempt for the franchise to do something different that most blockbuster films struggle with."

    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi attempts to use the past merely as a stepping-stone to build its own identity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rian Johnson has given us a breathtaking visual spectacle to go along with his plot, one which respects the viewer's intelligence and doesn't just hand-feed you. It's not just the characters that get a dose of expansion, but the saga as a whole."

    },
    {
      "text": "It is the most visually stunning of the eight Star Wars films, the characters speak with the elegance and wit... and the acting is often outstanding. It is exciting, funny, cute, tense, melancholy, smart, goofy, unexpected, and occasionally profound."
    },
    {
      "text": "Most fans will enjoy The Last Jedi but it won't be for everyone. While well crafted, the current batch of main storyline SW films feel a little hollow"
    },
    {
      "text": "Johnson unleashed one of the most spectacular visual feats within the Star Wars universe."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its heart is in the right place, more so than any of the other sequel films, but the conviction is lacking."

    },
    {
      "text": "I loved The Last Jedi. I loved its willingness to go to places that will surely anger legions of fans, I loved that it deepened the charismatic archetypes by exploring their hurts and haunts with deftness and humour."
    },
    {
      "text": "Brilliantly mesmerizing with a dazzling use of color, the action sequences are perhaps the best they've ever been, and the comedy in the film made a guy who generally rolls his eyes at everything laugh like a fool for two and a half hours straight."
    },
    {
      "text": "A superb addition to the Skywalker Saga which is sure to leave fans with plenty to talk - and argue - about, Star Wars: The Last Jedi now stands proudly alongside The Empire Strikes Back as one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all-time."

    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi runs like such a well oiled machine that its forgivable sputters and false starts stick out more than they might in a lesser film."
    },
    {
      "text": "THE LAST JEDI sits somewhere in the middle as a very good entry in the STAR WARS series. Johnson takes some risks with the story-maybe not enough of them to truly make THE LAST JEDI a classic"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi simultaneously condemns the notion of importance by virtue of birthright and elevates the power and responsibility inherent in the masses."
    },

      "text": "A lengthy list of missed opportunities and puzzling decisions."
    },
    {
      "text": "A world where women can be strong without the help of men, where princesses can become generals, and girls who come from nothing on a backwater planet can rise to become the hope of the galaxy."

      "text": "[It] is the best kind of entry into a franchise that takes unexpected risks, keeps you on the edge of your seat, and is emotionally moving in a way that will be leave fans stunned."
    },
    {
      "text": "Let's not mince words: This will be remembered as one of the best science fiction/fantasy movies of all time, and this backlash simply must stop, because that's no way to treat a near-masterpiece."
    },
    {
      "text": "Unnecessary the longest Star Wars film to date, but has some of the most epic ground-breaking moments in the franchise."
    },
    {
      "text": "A lot of the films ideas I like in theory but it was not executed well. The more I thought about it the less I liked it"
    },

      "text": "[Rian Johnson] succeeded on a lot of levels; I feel like there were a lot of other levels that didn't work as much."

    {
      "text": "The richest, most epic, most emotional Star Wars movie so far."
    },
    {
      "text": "A movie that allows for considerable plot development becomes stuffed to the brim with zigzagging, quick scene changes that left me sated, not satisfied."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's great to have a filmmaker who evidently has been a fan of the franchise since he was a kid, but still also an 'outsider' who dared to take the 40-year-old saga into unexpected paths."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a visually stunning movie, finding moments both macro and micro to highlight the beautiful imagination that Star Wars can evoke."
    },
    {
      "text": "I should say, that Star Wars the Last Jedi is the best Star Wars film we have to date by default. This film is a natural progression of the Star Wars films because it incorporates all the good things we loved about the previous Star Wars films."

    },
    {
      "text": "An enthralling and gripping piece of cinema that's both sublimely moving and visually beautiful, The Last Jedi, while flawed, is ultimately a breath of fresh air."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Rian Johnson] captured the tonal spirit of the preceding episodes and elevated it through bold and fresh ideas."
    },
    {
      "text": "When it works, it really works, but the fat overwhelms it all too often."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film starts off great and ends great, but sags in the middle. Still, well worth your while going to see, as it gives a good send off to a beloved character."
    },
    {
      "text": "A brilliant continuation of the saga that legitimizes the sequel trilogy and Disney's handling of the franchise.."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi is Disney's best contribution to the Star Wars canon so far and we can only hope that the final film of this trilogy will live up to the new standard."

      "text": "The Force Awakens came for your heart, but The Last Jedi is here for your spirit."
    },

      "text": "The Last Jedi is certainly an adventure that will pull you this way and throw you that way but never ceases to be anything but Star Wars"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi is a powerful, emotional and ambitious film that makes for one of the best films in the series."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film examines a questioning of ideals held throughout the ages, a deconstruction of what we know and hold dear."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Rian Johnson takes some major risks here. Some of them work well while other choices contribute to the film's uneven tone."
    },
    {
      "text": "It might not be what I wanted it to be, but I can't deny I was entertained."
    },
    {
      "text": "If The Force Awakens was an exercise in nostalgia, The Last Jedi is an experiment of expectancy. It pushes the boundaries of its characters, its audience, and the franchise's capacity..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi isn't the Star Wars installment anyone wanted. It's the one we all deserve."
    },
    {
      "text": "A problem that carries over from The Force Awakens and becomes more evident here is the sense that the villains, and villainy in general, have been weakly determined."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like bantha fodder riddled with kyber crystals, The Last Jedi is a jumble of really good and kinda bad."
    },
    {
      "text": "A glorious cinematic tour-de-force, a sci-fi gift that never stops giving, a real achievement."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi offers aimless entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film breaks many franchise traditions on all levels, but it does so with a lot of respect and with the ambition to build something new and exciting from what remains."
    },
    {
      "text": "If Awakens was about The Resistance and The First Order repeating the cycle of The Rebellion and The Empire, this one is all about how they have to become their own things and what the proper way to get there is going to be - and that's exciting."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi breathes urgent purpose into the new trilogy, purpose it had yet to prove."
    },
    {
      "text": "More than merely a continuation, The Last Jedi is in many ways an ending to the Star Wars we've known. And like many endings, it's anarchic and frustrating and poignant."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whatever the future holds for Star Wars, The Last Jedi will leave a lasting mark on this legendary series with numerous moments that are shocking and powerful with just enough humor to cut the tension."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's safe to say \"The Last Jedi\" is one of the best \"Star Wars\" movies ever made. It's right up there with \"Empire Strikes Back.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "Grabs the audience from the very first scene and doesn't let up, guiding viewers on a thrill ride that will have audiences gasping, laughing and perhaps even shedding a tear."
    },
    {
      "text": "Big, bold and beautiful. It's hard to describe Rian Johnson's achievements here any other way."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi manages to be both brilliant and terrible at the same time, a mix of classic mythos and insipid story telling."
    },
    {
      "text": "In every aspect conceivable, the film no longer operates between two realms, and the result is the most gratifying big-screen Star Wars experience thus far."
    },
    {
      "text": "I can only wonder what The Last Jedi might have been with Finn and Poe taking a backseat. Because there is a great film within what's ultimately a good one."
    },
    {
      "text": "[The Last Jedi is] proof that well-made franchise stories... can deliver a new engrossing chapter that respects the much-loved past while slowly closing the lid on it, and steer the ship in exciting, mature ways that push the boundaries..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi works. It's macro and micro stories entertain, either if you're predisposed to like what it has to offer, or at least not actively resistant to it."
    },
    {
      "text": "But on many levels, The Last Jedi is the antithesis of the virulent discourse it generates: a reminder that flaws can give way to strengths, that being willing to be wrong is a strength, and that doing the work, not getting the credit, is what matters."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whereas the first half is a sort of a convoluted mess. \"The Last Jedi\" becomes a dark and exciting sequel that becomes the film you've been looking for by the 75-minute mark."
    },
    {
      "text": "The success of The Last Jedi, like its father before it, will most likely rest on the conclusion of the trilogy."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the one we've been waiting for."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a two-and-a-half hour movie. It needs to be good in its own right, not just setting up for the next episode. A two-and-a-half hour, $200 million set up?"
    },
    {
      "text": "If you're a fan, you're going to appreciate the story continuing (on and on). If you're into makeup and CGI, you'll appreciate every minute of it."
    },
    {
      "text": "It calls the very idea of solo heroism into question. There are plenty of daring heroics in The Last Jedi and no shortage of characters who want to step into Luke's or Han's shoes, but now that impulse is shown to just make things worse."
    },
    {
      "text": "Along with non-stop action, there seems to be more wonder, whimsy and humor in The Last Jedi, some of it deliciously subtle."
    },
    {
      "text": "When it comes to pop cinema at this massive level, isn't it better for a movie to take Imperial-sized chances than just giving you what you want? I'll go with yes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Johnson takes the narrative through its paces, weaving a complicated and fascinating story. Just when you think one thing is going to happen, the story shifts."
    },
    {
      "text": "Thoughtfully humane and visually epic."
    },
    {
      "text": "A wonderfully directed, acted, and progressive film. Though it takes place in a galaxy far far away, the emotions and politics are very much here on earth today."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whereas JJ Abrams's The Force Awakens delivered a nostalgic joy that focused on reigniting a legacy I grew to love and obsess over throughout the years, Rian Johnson instead creates a nostalgia towards my years of childhood imagination."
    },
    {
      "text": "With deep reverence for what has come before, Disney has proven that they aren't afraid to move the story forward."
    },
    {
      "text": "The best \"Star Wars\" film since the original trilogy."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Star Wars\" is not \"Breaking Bad,\" and the same narrative tricks that worked for the latter feel jarringly out of place in the former."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is overall, a good movie worth watching. And timely, as our own modern-day First Order takes roots."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Last Jedi is a challenging and satisfying movie on many levels. It's fluffy and diverting at times but ultimately delivers a much-needed message about how hope will always reignite the resistance."
    },
    {
      "text": "[The Last Jedi] is one of the best-looking movies of the year, and crafts images never before seen in a Star Wars film. I'd definitely recommend seeing it in the cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The Last Jedi\" speaks for the strength of a united front against imperial aggression...The final image leaves us with the assurance that young people tired of injustice will pick up the ball their elders dropped."
    },
    {
      "text": "On a second pass, the questionable was extremely overpowered by the bold and the courageous, and I saw Star Wars: The Last Jedi through a different prism. I connected with it differently."
    },
    {
      "text": "Johnson has created a sequel that feels the most delightfully intimate in the series even if it is still unabashedly sprawling, hugely spectacular, and unapologetically commercial."
    },
    {
      "text": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi may not be perfect, but the need to accept imperfection and keep going becomes one of the movie's themes...It's about mentorship that's invigorating rather than smothering."

    },
    {
      "text": "I both loved it and strongly disliked it at the same time. I feel like there's a really great movie in there, all the pieces are there, everything is brilliant, but then there's a lot of extra fat that needed to be trimmed off or rearranged."
    },
    {
      "text": "At two-and-a-half hours, with about nine separate cliffhanger endings, it's a bit long, but Johnson's keen visual sense, doses of humor and a couple of cameos buoy the film"
