      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is one of Tom Cruise’s best films of late. The framework and structure is unique and well handled for the most part and is still exciting, even though the final act isn’t quite on the same level."

      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is a brainy sci-fi that will keep you on the edge of your seat."

      "text": "“Edge of Tomorrow” is a brilliantly written, acted, and directed sci-fi action film that keeps you on the edge of your seat."
    },
    {
      "text": "The joy of Edge of Tomorrow is that there are many endings, and in most of them Tom Cruise’s smirk vanishes from the screen forever to trouble us no more."
    },
    {
      "text": "Endlessly entertaining and ceaselessly innovative"
    },
    {
      "text": "Up to that forgivably underwhelming finale, Edge neatly synthesizes Cruise's ongoing fears of obsolescence and the fiscal pragmatics of its location into a witty story about the sheer tedium of self-improvement as a necessity for survival."
    },
    {
      "text": "There’s some good science fiction, strategic funny moments, exhilarating action, and a smart and sharp story that never grows dull."
    },
    {
      "text": "Regardless of the various other films that Edge of Tomorrow could be compared to, the end result feels strangely unique, and not for a moment during its two-hour runtime does it lose the audience to thoughts of its influences."
    },

      "text": "There's a certain unexpected humor coming out of \"Edge of Tomorrow\" that boosts its doom-and-gloom alien invasion setup."
    },

      "text": "Doug Liman’s sci-fi action thriller remains one of the most enjoyable American blockbusters of the previous decade."

    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is a rousing adventure filled with pulse-pounding thrills and surprising dashes of character-driven humor, the film a breathless two hours of fun worth celebrating."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even if I can’t forgive the ridiculousness of the final moments of \"Edge of Tomorrow\" ...  everything leading up to that ending still rules and does so even harder with the improved picture and sound."

    {
      "text": "The Angel of Verdun is an action heroine with the skills needed to ride into battle, but the empathy to reach out to the partner she just met."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first two reels are packed with energy and invention it's only when the conventions that made the story enticing are put aside in the last reel that the movie becomes a standard Cruise action flick."
    },

      "text": "Unexpectedly clever surprises keep the anticipation and mystification rolling, while the action sequences are plentiful and intense."
    },
    {
      "text": "On face value, Doug Liman's Edge Of Tomorrow deals with familiar tropes - of a war for the planet and time loops and alien invasions - but it's brilliantly executed with some fantastic combat sequences."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is proof, once again, that Cruise can certainly be knocked down but can never be counted as completely out."
    },
    {
      "text": "Liman deftly orchestrates the destruction, ensuring it doesn't sink into mind-numbing Transformers fare. Blunt and Cruise invest a great deal of heart in their action heroics, thankfully minimising the hokum romance angle."
    },
    {
      "text": "The strength of the lead performances and the inventive use of sci-fi conventions make this better than the usual mainstream fare."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow represents another consistent film from director Doug Liman. From projects such as The Bourne Identity, The O.C. to Mr and Mrs Smith, this film is by far his best work."

    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow deserves praise and viewers. It is proof that calculated cynicism and recycled content aren't the only ways to deliver big-budget, mainstream entertainment."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "This movie had the potential to be a great renovation for the alien invasion genre, instead it chose to be an incoherent love story. Edge of Tomorrow is entertaining but still, it's a waste of a good idea. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "Its visual universe has a strange brutal ugliness that tips into beauty, a complete, edgy and consistent world of ruin, cement and steel and harsh landscapes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tom Cruise is amazing in this. I know we always make jokes about him...put all that aside. He's an action star in this, he has great comedic timing. He really carries the film."

    {
      "text": "It is impossible to say how exhausting this film is -- by the fourth battle, I was gibbering."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's ... nice to see a film where outstanding visual effects are in place to support the story and not the other way around."
    },

      "text": "The whole film whizzes by."
    },
    {
      "text": "Most folks describe it as Groundhog Day meets War of the Worlds, and really, what's not to love about that infernal combo?"
    },
    {
      "text": "[Edge of Tomorrow] may not be as smart as it could've been in the broad strokes, but a clever, well-acted thrill ride like this doesn't really need to have its head fully in the game, now does it?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The lapses in logic are as numerous as the stars in the sky. But somehow it doesn't matter. Not only has Cruise and company delivered the first great action movie of the summer, they've tossed in a bit of philosophy, too."
    },
    {
      "text": "Credit a smart script, smarter direction, excellent production elements and an unflappable leading man for taking you to hell and back -- over and over again."

      "text": "A better video game movie than any movie based on a video game."
    },
    {
      "text": "Round and round we go waiting for Tom Cruise to sprint through enough time-loop cycles to figure out how to kiss Emily Blunt amid the tarantula aliens. Very exciting! But as usual they get the time-loop-as-reincarnation-metaphor all wrong."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Liman] reminds you that he was put on this earth to make popcorn thrillers. The ingenuity he brings to this disposable project is a sign of why Hollywood blockbusters continue to rule the globe."
    },
    {
      "text": "How Liman and Cruise deliver the repeated set-up scenes gives EoT plenty of light relief from warzone mayhem, the leading man's charms working a treat as he tries to convince those around him that he's seen it all before."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is a superb novel-to-screen adaptation, based on the novel \"All You Need is Kill\" by Japanese author Hiroshi Sakurazaka."
    },
    {
      "text": "The core of often feels like a prolonged montage, immaculately polished and vibrant, but lacking the depth or cohesiveness of more interesting and realized works of science-fiction."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frothy enough to conceal its own undercurrent of mindless action sludge."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow feels like it's about something more than action. Neat trick."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's easily the highlight of the summer movie offerings to me so far."
    },
    {
      "text": "Before too long, the plot begins to cut significant corners, things get terribly convenient and, by the end, the suspect plot logic utterly falls apart in favor of an idiotically beatific ending."
    },
    {
      "text": "To have a fun summer blockbuster with good characters, good action, and a tight and exciting script these days is almost unheard of. The smart sci-fi action movie is back. Let's hope it happens over and over again."

    },
    {
      "text": "Director Doug Liman has great fun with this just-go-with-it conceit."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is the kind of thoughtfully constructed movie that other summertime blockbusters should aspire to be more like, clever and cool and never giving you that ho-hum sense that you've seen it all before."
    },
    {
      "text": "As \"puzzle movies\" go, Edge of Tomorrow is one that holds up surprisingly well to scrutiny."
    },
    {
      "text": "A lot of it is very well done."
    },
    {
      "text": "With a tremendous first half and more brains, heart and laughs than any of its promotional material indicated, this is smart, witty, thrilling and, above all, fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sakurazaka's story has solid sci-fi credentials and Cruise proves that he still has the chops to pull off mega action movies. Edge of Tomorrow is one of his most compelling and nuanced performances in this genre."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cruise plays second fiddle to the luminous talents of Emily Blunt for a good chunk of the movie. Even at his best, he's a worthy equal but never superseding her swashbuckling charisma."
    },
    {
      "text": "At best, Edge of Tomorrow adds up to a videogame-compatible diversion."
    },
    {
      "text": "[A film that] will keep] you delightfully entertained for one hot summer afternoon. Even if you get the sense that you've seen it all before."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow's simple, smart pleasures include a look at how many screw-ups it can take to learn there may be things -- and people -- beyond yourself that are worth fighting for."
    },
    {
      "text": "The script, adapted by Christopher McQuarrie and the sibling team of Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, is actually ingenious in doling out its herky-jerky storytelling."
    },
    {
      "text": "...exactly the kick-ass, intellectual, science-fiction story everyone says they wish was made more often..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the rare summer spectacle that, tacked-on coda notwithstanding, might actually warrant repeat viewings."
    },
    {
      "text": "I've always said it: if only there could be an epic sci-fi version of Groundhog Day. OK, I never said that, but I'm glad there is one: it's called \"Edge of Tomorrow.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a fairly lightweight, but high quality summer movie. The kind you can just sit back and enjoy while you munch your popcorn."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a near perfect closed loop of a film: fun, well-conceived and never afraid to treat death with both the reverence and contempt that it deserves."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is a diverting enough, enjoyable, Tom Cruise war movie, but perhaps one that won't linger in the mind too long after the final credits have rolled."
    },
    {
      "text": "It used to be that there was cool, and there was Tom Cruise. Now, there's Tom Cruise in \"Edge of Tomorrow,\" which is cool on top of cool."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tom Cruise must've been grinning that Risky Business grin from ear to ear when he first read through the script for Edge of Tomorrow. He had to know he had a magnificent movie in his hands."
    },
    {
      "text": "Out of nowhere, Edge of Tomorrow is an exhilarating mix of Verhoeven-esque sci-fi subversion, existential comedy straight out of Groundhog Day, and the slaughter-and-reset structure of a first-person shooter game."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a bloodless romance and the action builds to an anticlimax, but the story is also adapted with surprising wit ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Overall, it benefits so much from the expert deployment of time-travel tropes that it earns a pass on a little alien acid blood."
    },
    {
      "text": "I had a better time than I expected."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow obviously cost a fortune to make, but it has a light, shrugging, tossed-off air that makes it all the more impressive, let alone enjoyable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, the title is bland to the point of meaninglessness. But that's just about the only thing Edge Of Tomorrow gets wrong."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shirks its responsibility to be about anything. Still, decent fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's harder to bear how the film fuses its sci-fi premise with an action movie's sensibility: one in which the characters become living, breathing video-game avatars, rather than human beings."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Edge of Tomorrow\" is big, loud and undeniably fun."
    },
    {
      "text": "It seems to know what we've all been forgetting since 1985: science fiction can be funny, blockbusters can be kooky, and Tom Cruise can, and should, be a jackass."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is a decent time waster, but if you're the sort of person who watches a movie every day, you should probably look for something better."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a beautifully executed jolt of darkly funny, smart-arsed sci-fi adventure. Welcome back Tom."
    },
    {
      "text": "The smartest blockbuster of this summer season, or perhaps any summer season."
    },
    {
      "text": "The reason the film works is because it throws everything into the blender and comes up with something new, something that has a great lively sense of wit and humor to it, and it takes the time to fully explore its wild premise fully."
    },
    {
      "text": "I can't say I was always quite sure what on Earth was going on, but Edge of Tomorrow, despite its flaws, despite its feeling of deja vu, manages to be tolerably entertaining mainly because of its nicely calibrated sense of humour."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow may be the best video game movie ever made. Which is strange since it isn't actually based on a video game."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bold concept which could have easily resulted in tedium, but not in Liman's hands"
    },
    {
      "text": "Cruise is a winner all the way, whether he's being a gung-ho hero or the butt of the joke."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its intriguing premise, engaging characters, and plenty of thrills to go around, Edge of Tomorrow makes for a breath of fresh air in a genre that has been crushed under monotony as of late."
    },
    {
      "text": "A deftly calibrated sci-fi spectacle."
    },
    {
      "text": "More story than testosterone, more time-jump-cuts than spacey filler, and more war-as-hell than war-as-cool. Leaves you pondering if we're 'masters of our fate' or just action-figures going through the emotions in some supreme player's idea of a war game."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an exceptionally entertaining, consistently humorous, and surprisingly moving story sporting top-notch visual effects..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tom Cruise once again shows why he's still a movie star in this exciting, inventive and witty sci-fi actioner."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cruise and Blunt take you on a (literally) loopy ride that's entertaining and doesn't wear out its welcome."
    },
    {
      "text": "Clever and fast-paced with a welcome streak of dark humor, this sci-fi actioner is undeniably entertaining, if ultimately not terribly substantial."
    },
    {
      "text": "It succeeds on modest terms, yet it's certainly not worth repeating over and over."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the writing and plotting in \"Edge of Tomorrow\" that sucks. Not the staging of scenes. Not the film's sense of humor. Not the film's quality action sequences."
    },
    {
      "text": "Doug Liman directed, making the most of every opportunity for a quick cut, a good laugh and a new surge of adrenaline."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is not a run-of-the-mill genre yarn in the vein of countless modern sci-fi blockbusters, but a fascinating and enjoyable vehicle that creates an ambitious illusion."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow is an ingenious action-comedy about how frequently movie heroes would actually die if they attempted that much crazy s***."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is a good bit of humor in the movie and the performances of Cruise and Blunt are spot on, with good supporting work from Bill Paxton, who plays a very hard-headed sergeant."
    },
    {
      "text": "Keeps the pace and dialogue snappy enough for a classic screwball comedy, at least until the inevitable overkill of the boom-bastic finale, centered on an alien-infested Louvre."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the best, most intelligent, most exciting and surprisingly funny special effects-laden epics I have seen in several summers. A model of cinematic craftsmanship from page to screen."
    },
    {
      "text": "The financial failure of EDGE OF TOMORROW represents the greatest inverse relationship between quality and ticket sales since TWILIGHT sent breathless teen girls storming into theatres."
    },
    {
      "text": "Smart, unpredictable, expertly designed, shot and edited, well acted and boasting impressive special effects, \"Edge of Tomorrow\" is science fiction and the summer blockbuster done right."
    },
    {
      "text": "...thrilling and unexpectedly comedic..."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you can believe that repetitions of death/life can be used as a slow build toward gaining on an invincible enemy, you'll appreciate that this creative team has made a movie in which there isn't a dull moment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Tom Cruise: in regards to Oblivion? All is forgiven."
    },
    {
      "text": "It features all the best qualities of memorable summer-movie thrillers - it's clever, cool and quirky to the point of almost being a bit silly - and when you leave, you may consider re-living the experience all over again."
    },
    {
      "text": "Edge of Tomorrow will get the easy comparisons to Groundhog Day but it's also exactly the kind of punchy sci-fi adventure that goes best with salty popcorn and a willing audience."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a movie that is constantly ahead of the audience, where smart characters do smart things to thwart a seemingly smarter menace."
    },
    {
      "text": "A reminder that the best kind of idiot fun comes from a place of very pointed intention, snug filmmaking, purposeful writing and acting."
    },
    {
      "text": "This film would have been well-made regardless of its casting, but the pairing of Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt is an inspired one."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though lacking the overall conceptual sophistication of modern time-warping classics such as Looper and Inception, Edge of Tomorrow is still more than capable of applying an unshakable grip upon the viewer from start to finish."
    },
    {
      "text": "Liman takes the movie's \"Groundhog Day meets Independence Day\" premise (adapted from Hiroshi Sakurazaka's novel All You Need is Kill) and runs with it a way that makes it more compelling than it theoretically should be."
    },
    {
      "text": "The concept of repetition is quite brilliantly done. It never feels \"that gag again?!\"."
    },
    {
      "text": "Liman's the brains behind the Bourne franchise, so one approaches the picture with great expectations of breathless action, depth of character and narrative dazzle. One is in for great disappointment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Doug Liman (\"The Bourne Ultimatum\") does a nice job of taking a script credited to three screenwriters and mixing in moments of humor with mostly non-stop action."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of Tom Cruise's best in years, Edge of Tomorrow steers clear of its source material's heaviness and just tries to entertain, which is does in spades, packing in the action and Director Liman's gallows wit approach to a Groundhog Day premise."
    },
    {
      "text": "Funny, suspenseful and terrifically imaginative, Edge of Tomorrow is a thinking-person's action film."

      "text": "Despite some quibbles, Edge of Tomorrow delivers the goods with ferocity and a funny bone, capturing intensity through the colorful details of involuntary rehearsal."
    },
    {
      "text": "Fluidly directed, ferociously acted, and intelligently written, it even takes the time to consider such lofty issues as the ennui of immortality and the nature of reality as it blows up nifty monsters from outer space. Blows them up real good."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hopefully, it will cause other filmmakers to realize you need more than a lot of blasts to make a summer movie - you also need to be a blast, which 'Edge' most definitely is."

    },
    {
      "text": "If 'Groundhog Day' and 'District 9' had an offspring, it would be 'Edge of Tomorrow,' an action-packed science-fiction romp. The story, which is based on 'All You Need is Kill,' a Japanese graphic novel, is whip-smart."
    },
    {
      "text": "We should pause to give sincere thanks to the film: on top of its cred as sheer big-screen entertainment, there's no prospect of an Edge of Tomorrow sequel or prequel, or of it being spun out into a franchise - and how friggin' rare is that these days?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The 51-year-old Cruise clearly relishes playing the flawed hero - one who gets to be smarmy, duplicitous, exasperated, intimidated, bad-ass and wise."
    },
    {
      "text": "With a reference to several films of the past, Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt successfully make everything old, new again in the 'Edge of Tomorrow.' Throughout the film, the story never runs out of steam, which should please and entertain audiences."

    {
      "text": "In a summer season filled with its own time loops (i.e. sequels, reboots, etc.), \"Edge of Tomorrow\" beats the clock."
    },
    {
      "text": "The conceit may sound constricting, but Liman (like Harold Ramis before him) gets exceptional mileage out of it, presenting his ever-revolving tale with visual style, narrative velocity, and a wonderful dose of dark humor."
