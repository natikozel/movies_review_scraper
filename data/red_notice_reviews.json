      "text": "Red Notice is not a movie. It is a $200 million existential crisis in light."
    },
    {
      "text": "For Netflix, it's all about the number of subscribers they can pull in, with the combined might of Deadpool, The Rock, and Wonder Woman. Red Notice is a criminal waste of money and everyone's time-except those who got paid $20 million."

      "text": "Red Notice is carried solely through star power, as our three leads deliver on some great banter. The film fun enough."

    },
    {
      "text": "To describe Red Notice as a whole lot of nothing could be understood as praise, up to a point. By design, there are no ideas worth mentioning in Rawson Michael Thurber's strenuously breezy caper."

    },
    {
      "text": "Turn off your brain, and you might have at least some fun with Red Notice. However, this brawny, bloated blockbuster is too short on new ideas and wastes its A-List cast for a cookie-cutter action flick that makes your Netflix subscription feel criminal."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's all too appropriate that Netflix's biggest blockbuster to date offers mediocre pleasures that feel wholly algorithm-driven. It's never less than watchable, but shoots so broadly for every conceivable demographic as to shirk creativity entirely."
