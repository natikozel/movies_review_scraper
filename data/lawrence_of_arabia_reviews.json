    },
    {
      "text": "It may be said that the weary melancholy underlying Lawrence of Arabia stems from the stupefying apprehension that, whereas England may have been doomed to civilize the world, no power under heaven can civilize England."
    },
    {
      "text": "As the larger-than-life, controversial, and complicated titular T.E. Lawrence, Peter O’Toole gives one of the singular performances in the history of film. His immense onscreen presence is a worthy juxtaposition for the man he portrays."

      "text": "Sixty years after its 1962 theatrical release, Lawrence of Arabia remains one of the greatest films ever made from an epic standpoint but it isn't without flaws."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is an epic, not just because it runs nearly four hours, but because of the measured and deliberate pacing, tangible sets and action sequences, and the willingness to explore humankind’s folly due to pride and greed."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is impeccably designed from every element on the screen, and words can often fail to accurately describe the elegance that is crafted."
    },
    {
      "text": "This motion picture is unlike any epic because after enduring so many perils in an enormous journey, the size of which had never been seen in a Hollywood production, the questions about T.E. Lawrence remain."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film’s real protagonist is the Arabian Desert -- a state of physical oppression and a state of mind made as compelling for the moviegoer as it must have been for Lawrence himself."

      "text": "\"Lawrence of Arabia\" is an intensely captivating biographical portrait of a brilliant and controversial figure whose character develops over the backdrop of World War I."

    {
      "text": "An undeniable technical achievement with its breathtaking scenery, epic score & gorgeous cinematography. The story isn't its strongest suit, but it can be overlooked by its visuals."

    {
      "text": "All in all, however, I would say that Mr. Spiegel and his associates have done a creditable job with an almost impossible subject."
    },
    {
      "text": "From the early shots laid on the sun-hot sands there is grandeur and awe-inspiring, stark splendor, against which men fight and die, battle for their ambitions and then see their dearest ideals crushed by uncaring, mercenary politicians."

    {
      "text": "Peter O'Toole s blond, Irish amd a captivating personality. He brings the character of T. K. Lawrence into splendid focus in the film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whatever Lawrence was, he makes an intriguing subject for dramatization. In the role, Peter O'Toole is most effective in conveying the many facets of the man's personality."
    },
    {
      "text": "Spiegel and Bolt and David Lean have run into an old problem with biographical art: they have invented too much to please biographers, and yet they have not taken the bolder liberties that make art."
    },
    {
      "text": "The script is taut and expressive and the musical score deftly attuned to the tale. Director David Lean has molded his massive material with skill, but personally I felt the film was too long,"

    {
      "text": "A supremely engrossing film, Lawrence of Arabia makes one forget that it runs nearly three and three-quarter hours: and sends one out haunted and shaken."
    },
    {
      "text": "The supporting cast can only be described as unbeatable. Jack Hawkins' Gen. Allenby, Alec Guinness's Prince Feisal, Anthony Quinn's Auda abu Tayi, Jose Ferrer's Turkish Bey and Omar Sharif's Arab warrior, are all outstanding pieces of acting."

      "text": "Peter O'Toole, an Irish actor new to films, makes an effective Lawrence, his skills putting much shading into a many-sided and contradictory character, and his support from an impressive cast is uniformly excellent."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a good movie -- a long movie, but not a minute too long. It's one you will enjoy thinking about afterward, and perhaps plan to see again."

    {
      "text": "he film touches all the bases in blood and thunder, photographs the Arabian desert in all its limitless desolation and yet fails somehow to shed much insight into the legend that was Lawrence."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is hard to recall any film that has put the wide screen to such impressive use."
    },
    {

    {
      "text": "One of the most magnificent pictures, if not the most magnificent, and one of the most exasperating."
    },
    {
      "text": "The honours, then, go to OToole, to Bolt, and to the director, Sir David Lean. The film is technically superb, and the desert photography, in Technicolor, is memorable for its beauty. My only great grief is its length."

    },
    {
      "text": "The big screen has frequently proved to be only too big; here it hardly seems big enough, and the implied compliment to Mr. Lean and his camera crew is considerable."
    },
    {
      "text": "[O'Toole] looks a good deal like Lawrence's portraits and he rides a camel with great authority. But he cannot project a sense of magic and, in moments of alleged spiritual agony, he merely looks dazed."

      "text": "This marvelous picture, whose photography is like a series of paintings on a great canvas, never diminishes its worth by using spectacle for spectacle's sake."

      "text": "Lawrence, as portrayed by Peter O'Toole with a career-making and career-defining performance, is one of cinema's most fascinatingly complex characters."

    },
    {
      "text": "The definitive David Lean movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robert Bolt's intelligent screenplay captures a portrait of a fiendishly complex, hopelessly idealistic individual and explores the politics at play."

      "text": "It combines an astute character study with some of the most jaw-dropping images captured on film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Lean and photographer Fred A. Young have combined their artistic talents in an evocation of the Arabian desert that makes it both terrifying and deeply moving in its lonely grandeur."
    },
    {
      "text": "It has an epic hero whom it doesn't hero-worship...[O'Toole] brings flawlessly to life the film's vision of a flawed warrior who is corrupted by pride, soured by empty victories and betrayed finally by the jubilant jump of his heart every time he kills."

    },
    {
      "text": "How did David Lean and star Peter O'Toole achieve such perfection? If we could define and distil it, we wouldn't need a special category for those flicks we call 'classics.' Lawrence of Arabia is that, and then some."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a movie with the excitement of a cavalry charge."
    },
    {
      "text": "To appreciate the film fully, Lawrence must be seen in a cinema, in 70mm on the widescreen and in stereophonic sound, and the present theatrical revival is not to be missed."

    {
      "text": "The passage of time has only proved how difficult it is to run ideas, history, characterisation and landscape in harness on this sort of scale."
    },
    {
      "text": "The only way to properly see Lean's overstuffed epic is on the big screen, the better to appreciate the glorious desert vistas, Maurice Jarre's soaring score and the glowing performance by then-unknown Peter O'Toole as a messianic T.E. Lawrence."

    {
      "text": "The chief fault is that the picture doesn't come close to explaining the complex and enigmatic character that was Lawrence."
    },
    {
      "text": "It reduces a legendary figure to conventional movie-hero size amidst magnificent and exotic scenery but a conventional lot of action-film clichés."
