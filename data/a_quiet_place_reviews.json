    },
    {
      "text": "Lupita Nyong’o’s face is the most effective visual effect in A Quiet Place: Day One. We commit to the story and the world because her eyes tell us so, but beyond her penetrating stare little else in the film feels persuasive enough to commit to."

    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place: Day One may not bring anything new to the genre or to its own cinematic universe when it comes to expand its borders, but it sure delivers top notch Human Drama as Nyong'o's performance elevates it all."

    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place: Day One” presented the opportunity to answer questions the first two movies didn’t exactly need to but it didn't. Maybe the filmmakers needed to give us a reason to watch “A Quiet Place Part III,” which seems likely the next step."

    },
    {
      "text": "The first two (especially the first one) had a dark, mysterious, and dangerous edge, but this one seemed slow, predictable and not very scary. It’s pretty grim and doesn’t offer a happy resolutions so it’s a strange summer film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Michael Sarnoski makes the jump from indies to blockbusters with Day One, but brings his character-focused sensibilities to the apocalyptic spectacle that’s been promised. It’s the best of the franchise by far."
    },
    {
      "text": "I wouldn’t say the movie is a classic of its kind. But Sarnoski, with help from his creative sound design and effects teams, fills a fleet 99 minutes with the high-anxiety stress movies such as this are meant to deliver."

      "text": "By the time Day One reaches its beautifully rendered and deeply moving conclusion, we're all in."
    },
    {
      "text": "It could have been a cheap cash-in that killed the mystery of the creepy sound-seeking monsters, but this prequel is instead a surprisingly riveting, intricately designed, even touching adventure."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place: Day One is worth watching. This silence-driven thriller adds layers of realism and immediacy to its suspense as it draws the audience deeper into the characters’ struggles."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it’s got that spine-tingling dread John Krasinski forged with the first two installments, Sarnoski refocuses the story into studying the basic decencies we’re capable of for our neighbors on the fly in the face of grave danger."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you’re looking for a film this summer that will deliver thrills, laughs, and heart, then A Quiet Place: Day One might be the movie for you."
    },
    {
      "text": "A wonderful prequel that continues to give prestige to the series. Nyong’o delivers one of the best performances in a franchise studio release this year in a story that will make the viewer appreciate daily life’s slow, quiet moments."
    },
    {
      "text": "While not quite a match for its predecessors, this wilful winding back of the clock to explain the origins of all that make-a-noise-and-die mayhem is not without its own merits."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a lot of melancholy and emotion to go with the jump scares and suspense."
    },
    {
      "text": "I haven’t felt this engaged with a depiction of the apocalypse in years. In such uncertain times, the greatest compliment I can give Day One is that it allowed me to process my own anxieties about the world through the power of cinema."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think this was the most emotional one for me."
    },
    {
      "text": "Credulity stretching logic gaps notwithstanding, though, [Sarnoski] keeps a healthy focus on character over spectacle and, in the early set-pieces, approaches it as a proper silent film, with Lyong’o’s wonderfully expressive face speaking volumes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Their unlikely, but touching, bond is the reason this series remains compelling, but also handing this project off to Sarnoski was a bold and wise move."
    },
    {
      "text": "Unlike the previous Quiet Place movies, I was never scared...  It's a good, solid piece of work but it's not on a par with the previous two installments, even though it has at its center a very good performance."

    {
      "text": "Other invasion films bank on the glory of fighting back for life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. “A Quiet Place: Day One” is all about the human spirit."

      "text": "A worthy companion piece to the first two Quiet Place films."

      "text": "For the human players, this is a showcase of strong, silent performance."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Quiet Place: Day One prioritizes strong performances and monster mayhem. Lupita Nyong’o and Joseph Quinn deliver exceptional performances. But the storyline is borderline idiotic and the Eric character dribbles stupidity in every direction."

    },
    {
      "text": "Some might argue that a prequel wasn’t necessary. We already saw the initial invasion in A Quiet Place II, but what Day One does compellingly is how it reveals the reality of when a city as bustling and boisterous as New York is forced into silence."

    },
    {
      "text": "The silent set pieces have the potential to get the best out of filmmakers or quickly slide into parody, but they've found a surprisingly emotional experience worth telling in fighting for the will to live vs. sliding into acceptance of one’s fate."

      "text": "A Quiet Place: Day One... happily retains the human scale of the earlier films. Although clearly inspired by Signs, War of the Worlds, The Thing and early Alien films, it was Polanski's The Pianist I was most reminded of."
