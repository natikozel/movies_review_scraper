    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, Superbad is a boy's story, so a certain perspective should be expected, and it's not the cheerful filth that bothers me, nor even the conventional morality; it's the paternalism."
    },

      "text": "... the love child of American Pie and Dazed and Confused."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad is a movie about partying and getting wasted and getting the girl, but as the night wears on, much wisdom is gained too, about self, friendship and the end of teenage innocence in all its wondrous, terrifying splendor."
    },

      "text": "Beneath the swearing and the tampon jokes lies a sweet-hearted tale of three chums celebrating the end of their carefree high-school days."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a simple tale about two horny kids not only on a quest for vodka, beer and sticky fumbling, but they're looking to find themselves in the process. I'll be damned if there's many people left in the cinema afterwards who won't relate to that."
    },
    {
      "text": "Honest goodwill, fond observational detail and Greg Mottola's exuberant direction make the picture nigh on irresistible, but there are some missteps."
    },
    {
      "text": "The affable trajectory covers enough guffaws to balance out the flattest visuals this side of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes"
    },
    {
      "text": "Like all Apatow productions, it's far too long but it has a winning combination of cleverly crude humor and genuine sweetness."
    },
    {
      "text": "What makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone-addled pups and what's going on in their heads, where they're still clinging desperately to the innocence they're leaving behind."

    {
      "text": "With Superbad, Rogen continues to show off his writing skills, delivering one of the most viciously funny movies since Super Troopers."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Cera] has some of the best comic timing of anyone working in film today, a precocious sense of the awkward pauses and misread cues in which social panic resides."
    },
    {
      "text": "The comic-duo of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera reminded me of an immature, foul-mouthed Laurel & Hardy."
    },

      "text": "even if Superbad's not much more than a teen comedy, it's the best teen comedy to come out in at least a decade. There's no shame in that."

    {
      "text": "Thanks to Rogen and Apatow we can once again look forward to seeing R-rated comedies."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raunchy enough, but it lacks some of the subtle wit and verbal sophistication that has always distinguished Apatow's finest comedies."

    {
      "text": "be sure to stick it out through the closing credits. You'll thank me later."

    {
      "text": "So bad that it's good, Superbad takes talking dirty on screen to a new level that will serve as shock treatment for some, and leave the rest in stitches."

    },
    {
      "text": "Solidifies Apatow's reputation as the guiding force behind a small but significant community of comic filmmakers. He is becoming to crude comedies what Steven Spielberg was to family-oriented fantasies in the 1980s."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad makes cultural statements that should be every bit as disturbing as blaxploitation's were."
    },
    {
      "text": "Young though they may be, lead actors Hill and Cera are adept in two different schools of comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "It will be a classic for years to come."

    {
      "text": "By turns funny and charming, heartfelt and horny, Superbad is a teen comedy that understands the awesome power of awkward."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's misogynistic, homophobic and only occasionally funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "Easily one of the funniest movies of the year."
    },

      "text": "Its keen sense of self-criticism makes it the superbaddest one of all."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you can stand the predatory assumptions, which are that girls are mere sex objects to most teenage boys, there's much more to this movie than the usual teen comedy. You can't help laughing even as you wince."

      "text": "Bawdy, demented and gloriously feel-good, Superbad is as super as comedies get."
    },
    {
      "text": "The observation of their insecurity and antagonism is very accurate; my problem is that it's not all that funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film proves only that a Hollywood fixated on the slapstick potential of teenage growing pains is finding it harder than ever to say, \"Bye, bye, American Pie\"."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a film that makes American Pie seem sophisticated, and it will have cultural critics shaking their heads and muttering about the death of Western civilization. I loved it."
    },
    {
      "text": "A knocked-down version of producer Judd Apatow's brand."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's pretty crass and pretty silly, but only a puritanical grump would deny it's funny."
    },
    {
      "text": "The highest gag-to-running-time ratio I can remember."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are some excruciatingly funny moments but there are perhaps not as many laughs as you would hope for given the script's comedy pedigree."

      "text": "Disappointment of the week."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's not for the easily offended, but look past the fabulously crude dialogue, and Superbad is one of the most consistently funny and enjoyable teen comedies in years."
    },
    {
      "text": "The funniest film since, um, Knocked Up. What it lacks in novelty it makes up for with consistency. Supergood."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's as if Mike Leigh decided to make a gross-out comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Doesn't quite have the insight of a classic, but it'll have you smirking for weeks."
    },
    {
      "text": "'Superbad' at its best goes right through knockabout to land in deliciously obscene places - notably a staggering succession of doodles in which tumescent cocks take on various extraordinary guises."
    },
    {
      "text": "The main idea behind Superbad is to put all the stupid things boys and girls do into one night of mayhem. Most of it is fuelled by drink and hormones and nearly all of it is from life."
    },
    {
      "text": "A genuinely hilarious teen comedy with a fantastic script and wonderful comic performances from its three leads."
    },
    {
      "text": "I find myself reflecting not upon the hilarity (of which there is more than enough here), but upon how desperately sad so much of the film is behind the booze and boob jokes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Equally hilarious and heartfelt, this is the best teen movie since American Pie and should make stars of the fantastic Cera and Hill."
    },
    {
      "text": "Hill, who I predicted big things for in my review of \"Knocked Up,\" is perfectly cast."
    },
    {
      "text": "It does contain some funny moments and even a few, really funny moments, but overall I didn't find it to be nearly so good as it has been built up to be."
    },
    {
      "text": "Funny, with echoes of Revenge of the Nerds and believe it or not, a bit of heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ribald repartée is the engine that drives the script, and the lead duo are nimble with the often-foul one-liners and fearless with the go-for-broke comic situations."
    },
    {
      "text": "Perfectly honest about the late adolescent male experience, in all its hilarious ugliness."
    },
    {
      "text": "For a comedy as anarchic and filthy as Superbad to end on such a convincing note of McLovin is an unlikely triumph."
    },
    {
      "text": "...subversively spry...one will come away with a strange sense of raunchy resonance that hasn't been quite felt before in aimless fratboy flatulent farces."
    },
    {
      "text": "Every teenage boy's fantasy is covered in this critic proof imbecile comedy that is crammed with gross-out humour, foul language and superbad taste."
    },
    {
      "text": "Absolutely filthy, but in an intelligent kind of way, \"Superbad\" storms onto the screen with chaos, profanity and hilarity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whenever it centers on its teenage characters, Superbad is a likable coming-of-age comedy; whenever it focuses on the tedious antics of the cops, it turns into a bad SNL skit."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad has one detail I've never seen in a teen movie before: The sight of kids drinking alcohol and gagging after every swig."
    },
    {
      "text": "A critical mass of these kinds of flicks argues for a new subgenre: \"nerdsploitation.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "In spite of the film's startling deluge of dirty dialogue and sight gags, tender notes are struck."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad may not linger in the memory, but its often riotous comedy is engaging and the journeys that Evan, Seth and McLovin take are, believe or not, eventually heartfelt."
    },
    {
      "text": "If Beaches was the ultimate chick flick, Superbad is one for all dudes, young and old."
    },
    {
      "text": "The reassuring message of 2007's most uproarious film is there's no prefab, encompassing approach to life - just a hope that stumbled-upon strengths will work. On the way, barking at the moon can be a great temporary defense mechanism."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the best teen sex comedies ever made."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is the kind of comedy that causes you to throw your head back, stomp your feet, and pound on the armrest. The laughs are so big that your whole body reacts, not just your mouth."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although Superbad often runs the risk of being a one-note joke, there's still enough heart to the story and appealing characters to highly recommend it. Superbad certainly isn't on par with other recent Apatow productions such as Knocked Up and The 40 Yea"
    },
    {
      "text": "High school virgins equipped with attitude and wit and resentment, they are, at the same time, kids who have no idea how to manage being high school virgins."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the film's generous heart and its depiction of the end of the era of adolescence that wins out, making Superbad more of a joy than a chore."
    },
    {
      "text": "American Graffiti, Sixteen Candles and Dazed and Confused, bow to your new master. It super freaking rocks."
    },
    {
      "text": "Somehow, the unlikely combination of crass comedy and romance really works."
    },
    {
      "text": "Imagine American Pie and South Park blending into one film."
    },
    {
      "text": "At its best it's naggingly and obscenely funny, but its 'heart' fails to convince."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad is easily one of the funniest comedies of the year and one you wouldn't mind seeing again and again."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad is funny stuff for the young at heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad is inspired coming of age comedy for real, nerdy, mixed-up, uncertain people; it's uproariously funny coming of age for the rest of us."
    },
    {
      "text": "You'll have to take about 15 showers to get the taint of \"Superbad\" out of your system, but laughter is almost guaranteed."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is rude and crude, but it's truthful about those elements, about its characters, and, above all, about the experience of being young and stupid."
    },
    {
      "text": "A relentlessly-raunchy cross between American Pie and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle, a laugh out loud teensploit that's every bit as funny as either of those classics."

      "text": "Getting some good, hardcore laughs this summer, thanks to Apatow and friends."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad is the perfect crude teen comedy to end the summer on. It's funny, a little bittersweet and it signals something coming to an end."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jonah Hill and Michael Cera displayed some of the best on-screen chemistry I've seen all year, and newcomer Christopher Mintz-Plasse squeezed his shtick in there at just the right moments."

      "text": "Superbad... sometimes a title says all you need to know."
    },
    {
      "text": "Even though it takes the low road, this guided tour of Loserville offers as many belly laughs as Knocked Up -- and that's saying a lot."

      "text": "It's Booty Call for the Knocked Up generation."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's no denying it's pretty funny, although you may hate yourself for laughing."
    },
    {
      "text": "One can almost imagine the characters portrayed by Hill, Cera and Mintz-Plasse growing up to be the Lebowski unholy troika of Bridges, Turturro and Goodman."
    },
    {
      "text": "Superbad is a funny, boozy, ramshackle party, but it's more likely to leave audiences with a tingly afterglow than a pounding hangover."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like attending a reunion or opening a yearbook, I know I'll be looking back fondly on Superbad for years to come, and laugh my ass off every time."
    },
    {
      "text": "[I] found the slapstick jokes silly but not funny; that the girls were just used as ciphers, representing temptation for the fellas; and that it ends with a gooey finish that fails to make the comedy as relevant as it seems to think it is."
    },
    {
      "text": "So is it funny? The best parts -- and there are many of them -- trigger fits of helpless, howling glee. Is it raunchy, depraved, filthy beyond all excuse or redemption? Only the best parts."
    },

      "text": "Superbad, essentially, is the filthiest episode of Freaks & Geeks ever."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Contains laughs galore, so many that the last one may get in the way of next one coming. But it's also got moments where you may want to cover your eyes to shield yourself from the sheer, wince-inducing familiarity of the behaviour on display."

      "text": "An avalanche of d--- jokes and strenuous slapstick."
    },
    {
      "text": "Every generation seems to have one iconic comedy that gets to a special place... and lives on forever as a true classic of its times. For this generation Superbad is going to be that film."

      "text": "For pure laughs, for the experience of just sitting in a chair and breaking up every minute or so, Superbad is 2007's most successful comedy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its young actors are pitch perfect."
    },
    {
      "text": "The soundtrack is, for some mysterious and yet immensely pleasurable reason, heavy on '70s funk. Like so many things in Superbad, it's a curious choice that manages, over time, to seem just right."

    {
      "text": "This hormonal answer to Reefer Madness is good, wacked-out fun."

    },
    {
      "text": "Even this middle-age hausfrau can appreciate the zonkered comic force behind Superbad, whose rambling plot and profane bull sessions reminded me of Danny Leiner's Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle."
    },
    {
      "text": "The writers shoot often and copiously, and they're obviously in love with their ability. Now, if they could just get some sort of focused, confident rhythm going, they might make things more satisfying for the audience as well."

    {
      "text": "... crude and sweet, rife with vulgarity yet redeemed by its generous spirit and intelligence. However filthy it is, it is not misanthrophic or even misogynistic."

    {
      "text": "Rogen and co-screenwriter Evan Goldberg are attempting to create a teen-angst comedy along the lines of 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and 'Risky Business'... In the best sections of 'Superbad,' Rogen and Goldberg hit their targets."
