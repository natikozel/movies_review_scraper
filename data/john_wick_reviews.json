      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 continues to bring what the franchise does best, even if gets a bit overindulgent with its stellar action at times."

      "text": "Few sequels can one-up their predecessors."

    {
      "text": "Nearly three hours of bone-crushing, elegantly choreographed violence: this is what great action movies are made of."
    },
    {
      "text": "As much as John Wick: Chapter 4 borrows from the previous films, its immense action set-pieces and general absurdity make this a wholly worthy entry and a fantastic cinematic spectacle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Part of the movie’s appeal can be traced to the class warfare on display. In Wick’s tired eyes and battered body, we see a symbol of the worker, whose labor is controlled by arbitrary rules and used to prop an indulgent and empty culture."
    },
    {
      "text": "It’s astounding how this franchise has steadily improved with each instalment, and this time around, Stahelski and co. laid all their cards down on the table and crafted an action masterpiece."
    },
    {
      "text": "The resonant boom of John Wick punching shakes up the auditorium; it is enough to make you jump right out of your seat. But it serves another fundamental purpose: to acclimatize you with the heavy-handed vibe of what’s about to follow."
    },
    {
      "text": "At some point, the original premise of the franchise– “if the worst man in existence found salvation”– runs its course and the saved becomes damned again."
    },
    {
      "text": "With Chapter 4, by thine own hand, Stahelski and Reeves have cemented John Wick as one of the greatest action franchises in cinematic history."
    },
    {
      "text": "What once felt like a breath of fresh air now reeks of mildew. It’s an aggressive feat of over-engineered popcorn violence that is either a mockery of its existence or, as the film says, a ghost seeking a graveyard."
    },
    {
      "text": "Chad Stahelski’s opera of violence is one of the most artistically stirring movies of 2023."
    },
    {
      "text": "The John Wick universe is a complex blend of gun violence, vague religious imagery, and some of the best dog actors around, and the fourth installment brought the action to a new level."
    },
    {
      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 really is a visual spectacular. With amazing fight sequences and a storyline that never signposts or becomes predictable this film is a film that deserves more credit than most will give it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yes, Donnie Yen plays another blind character (my theory is that filmmakers do this because nobody would buy that a Donnie Yen with two functioning eyes could ever lose a fight)."

    },
    {
      "text": "It is an incredible ride that is designed to entertain from the opening moments and the best way to enjoy it is to just hang on."
    },
    {
      "text": "This series always did a stellar job of not turning John Wick into a robotic machine, and Reeves always maintained a depth to this haunted character. The tenderness of a classically Reeves-ian performance is what is missing in John Wick: Chapter 4."
    },
    {
      "text": "They understand that it is the characters, the humour, and the jaw-dropping action that keeps us coming back for more. And as long as they keep this up, even in the form of spin-offs, audiences will continue to lap it up."

    },

    },
    {
      "text": "The entire series is a sisyphean journey of revenge. The audience knows that John Wick (Keanu Reeves) can never be free from this life of an assassin. He’s doomed to climb that 222-step staircase to Sacre-Cœur in Paris, both physically and metaphorically."
    },
    {
      "text": "A Bonafide Action MASTERPIECE. \n\nCementing John Wick as one of the greatest Action Franchises of all time. Once you think you’ve seen the coolest sequence it only gets better up until the final 30 minutes which completely had my jaw on the floor."
    },
    {
      "text": "With John Wick Chapter 4, Chad Stahelski crafts a grand sculpture of gunplay, feverishly yet methodically chiseled until its ultimate, explosive completion. A violent, ferocious symphony that encapsulates the very reason why we go to the movies."
    },
    {
      "text": "From the cinematography, an atmospheric score in all the right places, to a powerful conclusion in Wick’s personal’s story – it ends the franchise in the best way it ever could."

    },
    {
      "text": "The world’s most deadly wife-guy returns to inflict his brand of elaborately choreographed mayhem on anyone that’s left to get in his way. If we have indeed seen John Wick’s final headshot, it’s a well-executed conclusion."

    },

      "text": "This might be the most impressive John Wick film since the original, one that balances its bombastic fight sequences with plenty of compelling lore and surprising emotion. Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins steal the show."
    },
    {
      "text": "The best film in the John Wick action collection."
    },
    {
      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 is effective in every aspect, even when it demonstrates its faults at a full glance."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "By trading brains for bullets and characters for puppets, the director made the worst possible choices for this exhausting fourth chapter."
    },
    {
      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 packs in everything we love about John Wick, from high style to mysterious assassins to dogs to car chases to foot chases to a Looney Tunes level of gunplay. It’s the whole kitchen sink tossed on fire into oncoming traffic."

    },
    {
      "text": "I can’t say whether John Wick: Chapter 4 is better or less-good than the other Wicks, but it’s easily the funniest – and that reflects the restless creativity of its makers."

    {
      "text": "This pulp one was more entertaining than the others in the series."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Tom Cruise is jumping bikes off a ramp in Norway, Reeves is whipping reverse 180s on a famous circle drive in Paris while shooting bad guys. That’s him doing just about every ounce of stunt work and fight choreography. He’s in a league of his own."
    },
    {
      "text": "The whole arc, with its excesses and ridiculousness, ends up closing –but above all, it seems to condense– not only the leit motifs of the saga, but almost everything that has been choreographically action cinema of the last 20 years."
    },
    {
      "text": "Translation: We can consider ourselves fortunate, because this self-aware delight, committed to the cause of relentless entertainment, has transformed cinematic action into a true work of art."

    },
    {
      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 is not just the magnum opus of the series, it actually corrects a problem that the series has had for a while, a question we haven’t had an answer for over the last couple of films.\n\nWhat does John Wick want?"
    },
    {
      "text": "“John Wick: Chapter 4” is by far the strongest film of the franchise with some of the best action in film history. The rewatchability factor will demand multiple viewings, and after seeing this movie, your eyes and mind will never be the same."
    },

      "text": "Its less like a [three-hour] fight sequence and more like an incredibly bonkers ballet"
    },
    {
      "text": "The best film in the series, featuring four or five action set pieces that are breathtaking."
    },
    {
      "text": "There isn’t much dialogue because there never is in a movie involving hitman Wick. Once again, Keanu Reeves plays him with as much taciturn moodiness as possible. He’s sullen, silent, and strong through 169 relentlessly supercharged minutes."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"John Wick 4\" hits the mark. This grand ballet of mayhem and ultra-violence goes on a bit too long but is never dull. The story threads aren’t the most complex, but Keanu and friends commit to the action and it’s stellar."
    },
    {
      "text": "Clocking in at a hefty 169 minutes, the fourth Wick movie spreads its wings and goes full-blown epic. Every single shot is a dazzler, it has a surefooted pace, and the simple story is elevated to mythical status."
    },
    {
      "text": "... Overkill in more ways than one. All that said, there are some extraordinary fight sequences, leavened with cherishable wit."
    },

      "text": "No matter how a John Wick movie finishes, it ends with viewers wanting more — and this is no exception, including more of Yen as Caine alongside Keanu."
    },
    {
      "text": "Who knew the Wickiverse was a (murderous) utopia?"
    },
    {
      "text": "A nearly three-hour orgy of mayhem that’s flashy, raucous, brainless and as nutritious as a Twinkie.  But fans will eat it up and, like Oliver Twist, ask for more.  Others might feel not just glutted by the excess but somewhat nauseated by it."
    },
    {
      "text": "If there were an Oscar for \"best headshot effects\" this movie would win it.  And its over the top, senseless and overly long plot would lost it every other accolade possible."
    },
    {
      "text": "Emphasizing spectacle over substance at every slow-motion turn while trying to constantly outdo itself, this ambitious sequel feels like a director’s cut that could have benefited from some judicious trimming."
    },
    {
      "text": "The strongest chapter in the Wick saga and of the best Hollywood action films of all time! The magnetic characters -especially Donnie Yen- anchor the brutal and beautiful torrent of mayhem. [Full Review in Spanish]"

      "text": "The Godfather II of action movies. Blisteringly entertaining, and packed with some of the best action and fight sequences ever put on film"
    },
    {
      "text": "Somehow retains the sense of basicness that led the original to such prominence, whilst layering itself with the operatic expansion of its near-video game-like ultimation."

      "text": "The fourth film in the very entertaining John Wick series delivers lots more action and even some affecting consequences."
    },
    {
      "text": "Energised by a swaggering electro-rock score, this is pulp cinema at its most giddy and gleeful."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bring on the stunt people- John Wick is back in town."
    },
    {
      "text": "An absolutely excellent, masterful final lap for the series with Reeves dedicating himself to the action movie art form."
    },
    {
      "text": "This installment of the series offers nearly three hours of action, humor (a 4DX bonus), and sweeping landscapes. All come with high kill and diversity scores. There's also an Easter egg for East Asians."
    },
    {
      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 is explosive, nunchuck-bashing, bone-crunching cinematic ecstasy that allows action junkies to gorge on a buffet of bullet casings and broken necks."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's impossible not to applaud the audacity in opening the movie with a reference to Lawrence of Arabia and ending it with one to The Warriors, not fearing comparison despite the prejudice with which the genre is seen by many. [Full review in Portuguese]"

    {
      "text": "A brutal fourth installment, which offers the right dose of action almost at the same level as the previous chapters. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 did not need to be nearly as long as it is, but in this case, the excess is the point. Much of it is ridiculous and ridiculously violent, but it’s also highly entertaining, which is all you can hope for from this type of film."
    },
    {
      "text": "After this installment, it’s hard to see how another sequel would even be necessary beyond Reeves and Stahelski challenging themselves to make something close to one of the greatest action spectacles of all time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Chapter 4 is resoundingly the best Wick sequel – but I still prefer cold-blooded efficiency over bloody excess, no matter how artfully and, at times, playfully staged."
    },
    {
      "text": "Aside from spectacular fights, it really doesn't have much else to recommend it. There is little character development, and the story is kind of loopy. But you know what you are going to get with this kind of film, and it does deliver what it promises."
    },
    {
      "text": "The meal itself is entertaining and a testament to stunt craft, but it's probably the weakest of the franchise in terms of overall success. Thankfully, that's still good enough."
    },

      "text": "Caps off what I think we have to regard, at this point, as the best and most-consistent action franchise in American cinema history."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first  great blockbuster of 2023 and one of the greatest action films I've ever seen."
    },
    {
      "text": "This movie did not disappoint, and the bar was high... It's creme of the crop premier action."
    },
    {
      "text": "JWC4 is an elaborately choregraphed, gorgeously crafted slaughter fest. A blood-thirsty spectacle. A circus of scoundrels fighting to the death in the most gracefully violent ways."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's wild and bombastic...from a directional standpoint, I think this is Stahelski's best work so far in the series."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Is the film] a profoundly inane exercise in empty violence or a transcendent ballet replacing exposition with movement? ... To quote Wick, \"Yeah.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "Whatever happens next, Reeves and co have their work cut out to top John Wick: Chapter 4."
    },
    {
      "text": "Just think: All this carnage, all this fun, all for the want of a dog. Few can beat that."
    },
    {
      "text": "It’s a great way to spend an afternoon at the cinema and worth the price of admission."
    },
    {
      "text": "The final 45 minutes of the film includes three set pieces that, while interesting and certainly fun to watch, frequently push the laws of probability and physics far beyond their breaking points."
    },
    {
      "text": "John Wick: Chapter 4 won’t win over any doubters, but it will please the fans. If it is the end to the films series (a TV show is in the works), this caps off a thrilling and consistently entertaining franchise in the best way it can."

    {
      "text": "They give John Wick nunchucks in this one. That's my review of 'John Wick Chapter 4.'"

      "text": "It was such a thrilling, immersive experience. With its high octane action and breathtaking stunt choreography."
    },
    {
      "text": "A tantalising offering to an already solid franchise. Slick action, scrumptious visuals and top tier cast additions made this an epic ride!"
    },
    {
      "text": "No easy feat for a franchise that’s attempted to top itself with each subsequent film, but Chapter 4 celebrates everything that’s made these movies work so well for this long."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's unrelenting and relentless... it is epic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Reeves gives more of the super-chill guy we love, though the most fun looks to be had by Skarsgard whose Marquis dresses in immaculate costuming. He camps and vamps through his role."
    },
    {
      "text": "Across an enormous running time, the film builds up a compelling tale of revenge and redemption that's unusually involving. And of course it looks fabulous, with colourful design touches and outrageously intricate fight choreography."
    },
    {
      "text": "Almost 10 years later, the John Wick franchise is still delivering the most unbelievable action sequences in film in recent years. This time around the universe building is more important than the otherwise bland main character. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "Nearly three hours of John Wick? You’re gonna need a bigger popcorn."
    },
    {
      "text": "Interesting elements [are stretched] far too thin with bloated, excessive fighting sequences ... The gratuitous violence and commando shooting do not offend me, but the film's superfluous, meandering runtime certainly does."

      "text": "Everything you'd want out of an action movie!"
    },
    {
      "text": "Graded by the volume of quality kills, call it a success of excess."
    },
    {
      "text": "If the first John Wick film raised the bar for the spectacle of fight-based storytelling while reinforcing Keanu Reeves as a bona fide action star, JW4 redefines the gold standard for the genre."

    {
      "text": "Three hours of relentless shooting and little acting makes the fourth film in the Wick franchise an epic disappointment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Just like movie theatres bore audiences with trailers and commercials before rolling out the main feature, Chapter 4 makes us wait far too long for the new ways in which Stahelski has reimagined the action sequence."
    },
    {
      "text": "It would be a disservice to continue the saga after it has reached its highest point. The fourth installment of this action franchise is undoubtedly the best."
    },
    {
      "text": "The John Wick franchise is two things: a fantasy world with rules and consequences for breaking them, and a series of films crafted with extraordinary care and meticulous attention to detail."

    },
    {
      "text": "While the action is absolutely terrific, it really is the cast that keeps this train running, delivering some of the most preposterous-sounding dialogue with such dedicated gravitas that you can’t help but buy into this crazy universe."
    },

      "text": "Watch the film for its never-seen-before action sequences, as also for the pleasure of watching two masters of action, Keanu Reeves and Donnie Yen, giving their best to the film."

    {
      "text": "Expect three hours of furious fistfights, stylish cinematography, and some of the industry’s best stunt performances."
    },
    {
      "text": "While other, equally ridiculous action films race to mock themselves before the audience gets the chance, John Wick dedicates that energy to proving that everything that’s dumb about it is actually rad."
    },
    {
      "text": "With a runtime that, if you include the closing credits, sniff three hours, Chapter 4 is an action romp that’s over-the-top even by Wick-ian standards."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's wild to be saying that everything matters in the fourth movie in a series about a guy whose dog was killed by bad guys, but here we are. It's popcorn entertainment, obviously, but it's popcorn entertainment done just right."
    },
    {
      "text": "“John Wick: Chapter 4” is a full-on action extravaganza and an unforgettable cinematic experience. It’s an adrenaline-fueled spectacle but with a beating heart. It’s also one of the best action movies of the last decade-plus."
