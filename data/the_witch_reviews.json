      "text": "Elevated symbolically with Eggers’ commentary on how fanatical faith is impossible to live up to, and how that churns out something evil, despite its good intentions. All of that is delicately crystallized in the final moments of The Witch..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch has been aesthetically compared to that of The Shining and The Crucible, and it is easy to see why. But that fails to give enough credit where credit is due: Eggers has a unique direction style..."
    },
    {
      "text": "…finishes on a few memorable flourishes, even if it ends roughly where one might have hoped that it would start. Nevertheless, the slow burn is effective, and Eggers deserves credit for ploughing a fresh furrow in the annals of witchcraft film-making…"

      "text": "Robert Eggers' directorial debut is an exercise in restraint. That's his most terrifying asset and it pays off..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It chilled me in ways I am not even sure I was meant to be chilled. The language was very historically accurate, the environment felt isolated and hopeless and I loved how dug in the film was to documented cases of witches."

      "text": "It’s impossible to leave “The VVitch” and not feel you’ve seen something unique."

      "text": "Eggers has made an unforgettable film that leaves us eagerly anticipating what he'll do next."

    {
      "text": "An incredible debut for Anya Taylor Joy. Haunting, thrilling, and accompanied by a strong score."

    {
      "text": "A chilly horror film that'll nibble away at your nerves..."
    },
    {
      "text": "I thought the soundscape was amazing in this movie... I felt like if it didn't have that soundscape going along with the images it wouldn't have been as scary as it was."
    },
    {
      "text": "Eggers' meticulousness, no doubt honed in his former job, is the source of this film's strength."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like any good horror film, The Witch is rife with opportunity for allegorical interpretation, and one of the most compelling narratives bubbling beneath surface is the origin story of America itself."
    },
    {
      "text": "The kind of horror film that is not content to simply say \"Boo!\" There are few, if any, jump scares in the film. Instead, it's the kind of puritanical folk tale that slowly burrows itself into your brain, leaving you queasy and uneasy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Filled with memorable imagery, from the cleverly shot, heart-stopping game of peek-a-boo to the stunning final few moments, The Witch is a haunting must see."
    },
    {
      "text": "Visually, it rules, and is well worth a watch, even if you're a weenie who is worried about intrusive night thoughts."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch is a totally messed up movie, in a good way. By the very nature of the story, the film begins at a simmer that slowly builds and builds until it's boiling over with insanity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Where bad horror movies settle for lazy tricks and easy outs ... The Witch is in a class rarely visited."
    },
    {
      "text": "Steeped in the religious conviction and paranoia of 17th Century New England pilgrim life, this is more dirt-smudged tension and distrustful atmosphere than jump scares and monsters hiding around corners."
    },
    {
      "text": "Those that patiently - and bravely - sit through The Witch will find an unsettling movie, loaded with tension that keeps escalating until the film's final frame."

    {
      "text": "The Witch is a sumptuously atmospheric tale of horror."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch slowly cranks up a feeling of mounting dread. It feels transgressive, forbidden. Robert Eggers and his talented cast and crew have made something special."
    },
    {
      "text": "Seems like it was created out of the Platonic ideal of a Hammer-period horror film, with all of the creep and none of the camp."
    },
    {
      "text": "An odd mixture of fanatical religious paranoia and actual supernatural horror, which creates a fascinating, successful hybrid."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch aims for an engrossing, period appropriate realism that only deepens the psychological burden on the audience."
    },
    {
      "text": "The biggest magic The Witch has to offer is making 93 minutes feel like the rest of your natural life."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its masterful blending of the sacred and the blasphemous makes it not just a great horror film, but perhaps the first true horror masterpiece of the new century."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rather than try to establish any tension, Eggers prefers to utilize poor jump scares sporadically between artfully composed shots, all of which amounts to little."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its historical allegory ensures The Witch stands out, but it does become a little slow and murky with details as it feels its way through to the dramatic finish."
    },
    {
      "text": "A good horror film makes you scared to turn off the light, and makes you run when you could have walked. THE WITCH will undoubtedly be one of those films."
    },
    {
      "text": "The horror is cumulative, and the escalating, asymmetrical shape of Eggers' story is a nice change of pace for the genre."
    },

      "text": "This film is true terror. You will not find jump scares. [Full Review in Spanish]"

      "text": "The Witch isn't just a great horror film; it's a great film, period."
    },
    {
      "text": "He visto un centenar de películas de terror en lo que llevo de vida, pero ninguna como The Witch. Nunca antes algo me había dejado tan estupefacto, extasiado, y aterrado. Todo al mismo tiempo."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film's sense of brooding, lurking menace is exceptionally chilling, precisely because director Robert Eggers entwines it with ordinary family life, and children being children."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch creates a world that feels stifling and claustrophobic, even though it's set in an open land with no one else around for miles."
    },
    {
      "text": "All of the strained stabs at supernatural ambiguity feel soulless. While certain visuals are undeniably frightening, most of the film fails to incite the kind of visceral sense of helplessness associated with the best horror films."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch has amazing acting, haunting music, beautiful cinematography, and a compelling story."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is one of those movies that draws you into its world and holds you inside it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robert Eggers's queasy folktale of a banished clan of pious farmers questions both the virtue of a God-fearing life and insists upon the evil in the mundane."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch is a good movie - a solid effort with several chilling moments from a director on the rise - but much like It Follows last year, this is not reinventing the wheel."
    },
    {
      "text": "Mark Korven's simple, sometimes dissonant score of heightened natural sounds and fiddle seems authentic, and raises the hair on the back of your neck, it's beautiful and fearsome by turns."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film's desperate search for a missing child combined with its arthouse sensibility suggests a Walking Dead episode directed by Bela Tarr."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch does for the woods what Jaws did for the ocean. They're ruined for you."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The Witch\" is an artistically striking film - it's truly a visual work of art. Unfortunately, it just couldn't decide if it was a psychological or paranormal horror film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Perhaps due to some sort of satanic intervention all of this comes from a director who had not yet created a feature film prior to The Witch."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch doesn't focus on shock or gore; instead it's visually stunning and completely engrossing -- and a true thriller, giving us more suspense than horror."
    },
    {
      "text": "For me The Witch was stunning, a brilliant tale that deserves to be a genre classic-but you should probably know what you're getting into."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sparse in dialogue and relentlessly bleak, The Witch will likely appeal to those who like their horror stripped back to basics, but boy does it pack a punch sometimes."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's plenty that beguiles in Robert Eggers' moody film The Witch."
    },
    {
      "text": "Although mainstream horror movie fans might not warm to its methodical pacing, the unnerving atmosphere director/writer Robert Eggers creates can be compared to genre classics like Rosemary's Baby."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robert Eggers's thriller about the supernatural in Puritan New England will get under your skin."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch is unnerving to your bloodstream all the way to the very core of your heart, as Robert Eggers successfully demonstrates that he understands horror, and how to actually create something of artistic merit from the genre"
    },
    {
      "text": "It's only when the family's livestock become involved that cracks appear in the earnest surface. I haven't cackled so much since the satanic goat in Sam Raimi's Drag Me To Hell."
    },
    {
      "text": "That the film climaxes with an inexplicable change of heart for a major character (or was it a reveal? It's impossible to tell for sure) suggests that Eggers may have taken from one too many sources to patch this thing together."
    },
    {
      "text": "Eggers is clearly first and foremost a film-maker rather than a historian and the urge to entertain eventually prevails."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch is an exceptionally well-made horror movie that relies on character-driven drama to create fear, not cheap gimmicks."
    },
    {
      "text": "See it with someone you enjoy arguing with."
    },
    {
      "text": "[The Witch] convincingly makes us believe that such supernatural elements could be real, and that we are watching an account that feels terrifyingly of-the-moment."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch plays mercilessly on our dread of what might be lurking in the shadows, rather than actually showing much onscreen-and is all the more effective because of it."
    },
    {
      "text": "As in any good horror film, The Witch is ripe with allegorical possibilities."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch wants to be jump-out-and-scare-ya scary in addition to being dreadful-scary, but it's not."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are more interesting ways to explore how afraid we are of girl sexuality and how god-fearing Christians can use their faith for destruction."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch's brief jolts of violence seem perfectly calibrated to knock us out of our seats: not by generating horror on the screen, but within our viscera."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The VVitch\" succeeds by delivering up encroaching menace with a mysterious disregard for audience expectations."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the reasons The Witch works as well as it does is because, despite its name, the movie isn't a horrific folktale about a paranormal being, but rather a look into the depravity of what humanity can become."
    },
    {
      "text": "What's refreshing, and frightening, about \"The Witch\" is that Eggers allows no modern consciousness (scarcely any comic relief either) to intrude upon the anguish."
    },
    {
      "text": "The stakes are real. The Devil is real. All roads do not lead up the mountain. Some lead to the heart of darkness, to the depths of a witch-haunted wood."
    },
    {
      "text": "This isn't the kind of movie most horror fans are going to flock to."
    },
    {
      "text": "Set in Puritan era New England, The Witch is an atmospherically driven, religion-coated film that is, at times, both beautiful and terrifying."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is potently imagined and beautifully wrought -- although its hold loosens considerably when it strays from its eerie highpoints and into more conventional horror territory."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's startling to see a movie with such an appreciation and aesthetic understanding of this too-infrequently filmed era."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Witch is a solid, compelling, thought-provoking movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "A slow-burn pace helps ratchet up the dread, along with the work of cinematographer Jarin Blaschke, who casts the action in cold, gray, unforgiving light. And an exceptional cast makes it all resonate."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film starts with wordy wittering and ends by trying to woo our shrieks -- from Arthur Miller to Dennis Wheatley in the shortest time possible between two blunt points."
    },
    {
      "text": "For pure spooky atmosphere, The Witch is unmatchable right now."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whatever your world views, simply watching the film should leave your soul intact... mostly."

      "text": "A masterpiece of atmospheric horror and a true example that fear can be generated without the need of jumpscares. [Full review in Spanish]"

    {
      "text": "Right through the very end it's an absolutely awe inspiring masterpiece steeped in everything from folklore, urban legends, and fairy tales."
    },
    {
      "text": "A slow-burning, utterly immersive, claustrophobic, chilling little number."
    },
    {
      "text": "You'll want to watch The Witch again and again, finding new layers and possibilities each time."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm fairly positive scares are not the point. Eggers takes things to a place that's far more disconcerting, showing how human nature can be the most destructive of all forces."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robert Egger's directorial debut is a deeply unsettling experience that will leave a residual impression akin to a scar on the skin."
    },
    {
      "text": "Robert Eggers ramps up the tension by setting his tale in a familiar-yet-foreign locale and using the natural terror of isolation to prompt chills and thrills from audiences."
    },
    {
      "text": "An oppressive, claustrophobic and occasionally shocking feminist tale that's just as much about a young girl coming of age in a fundamental Christian household as it is wicked, broomstick-riding evil lurking in the woods."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the most stimulating and rewarding films in either of is genres - horror and costume drama - that one could hope to find."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Though there is some real horror-movie imagery on hand, writer-director Robert Eggers also summons dread with small farmhouse touches: the thwack of an axe on wood, the eyes of a goat called Black Philip, the rustles of branches."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you aren't a fan of Witchcraft based horror films, this isn't going to change your mind. At times confusing, creepy, and has brief spurts of over the top bloodletting. I left wondering, what did I just watch?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The somber religious drama works just fine as a contemporary American indie curio, with excellent historical detail."

      "text": "Cerebral horror where what you don't know is what scares you the most. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "As horror films go, the film is more slow burn than an edge-of-your-seat thriller, but it builds steadily to its dreadful and earned conclusion."
    },
    {
      "text": "A great film that in concept, deal on how religious fanaticism can take you to the extreme opposite: paganism. [Full review in Spanish]"

    },
    {
      "text": "The lack of answers and stifling cultural specificity are what give The Witch its gnawing power."
