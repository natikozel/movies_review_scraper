      "text": "ANT-MAN & THE WASP: Quantumania feels more like a Disney+ special than a film.\n\nIt’s messy, overindulgent on weak CGI, and humor falls flat. Jonathan Majors is great as Kang but Marvel seemed more focused on creating a 2-hour trailer for something better."

    },
    {
      "text": "The film covers no new ground, offers no new concepts. and introduces almost nothing fresh in the way of storytelling or character development. Rudd and Reed made a solid duo in the past, but this time around the formula stands out more than the charm."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's nice Hollywood's been scouring metaphysical and cosmological texts and translating them into comic book popcorn entertainment (The Quantum Realm!) but the over-usage of CGI as a lazy replacement for the craft of good storytelling is tedious."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are some truly fun pieces to it, some genuinely inventive and impressive visuals, and a mostly likable cast. But it doesn’t do enough to separate itself from the blurred, messy palette that the MCU has become to truly stand out. It’s… fine."
    },

      "text": "Tentatively pushing into broader fantasy cinema, it retains frissons for those of us who did grow up having our imaginations blown open by Jack Kirby."
    },
    {
      "text": "As far as superhero action movies go, this one works well enough. There is plenty of action and plenty of imaginative eye candy. The acting is good. The soundtrack is also solid. It should prove to be a popular addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

      "text": "It suffers from some script problems in the first half, but it ultimately delivers a bonkers but exciting gateway to the next Marvel phase."
    },
