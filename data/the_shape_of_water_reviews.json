    {
      "text": "Guillermo del Toro’s The Shape of Water is a beautiful and fully realized film about loneliness and our desire for love."
    },
    {
      "text": "Del Toro has made a film whose dark, sublime, watery beauty is indisputable, and whose story is as much an intriguing \"beauty-and-the-beast\" ballad as it is a captivating homage to the different and the extraordinary."
    },
    {
      "text": "However, while The Creature from the Black Lagoon was darker, in The Shape of Water he is a more humanized and warm being, here he is the victim and not a threat, the typical scheme that we know from King Kong (1933) is no longer repeated."
    },
    {
      "text": "The meticulous craftsmanship is to be expected in any del Toro film and only adds to the magic spell he puts us under."
    },
    {
      "text": "It balances a harsh 1960s setting with fairy tale magic painted into its big, beautifully-detailed sets. Only del Toro could pull this madness off."
    },
    {
      "text": "You’ll either be charmed by Hawkins’s ethereal, wordless performance or you won’t, but del Toro’s use of a vivid colour palette would impress anyone."
    },
    {
      "text": "Touching and surreal..."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is no subtlety whatsoever. You can practically hear del Toro beating his pulpit through much of Shannon’s dialogue."
    },
    {
      "text": "With a narrative that resonates in unexpected ways, the film offers a showcase for the talents of its stunning ensemble cast, especially Hawkins, who embodies innocence without becoming a symbol or losing her humanity."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape Of Water is another success for Del Toro, who has yet to received a Best Director nomination at the Academy Awards but looks to be on his way to his first. A film that should be looked at and appreciated for its beauty and message."

    {
      "text": "An unadulterated celebration of classical romance, monster movies, and the captivating sorcery of filmmaking."

    {
      "text": "Leave your cynicism at the door-- there's no place for it here."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ultimately, del Toro's masterpiece is an utter triumph in finding love and humanity in the most unlikely of places - and it asks us to do exactly the same."
    },
    {
      "text": "Without making a sound, Hawkins delivers a moving, entirely gestural performance that has charmed critics."
    },
    {
      "text": "Social politics have always provided del Toro's films with both subtext and context but The Shape of Water is the most literal translation of his embracing of the Other as beautiful..."
    },
    {
      "text": "A romance between two characters who never speak which means Del Toro must depict their love only in visuals. This leads to many beautiful cinematic scenes, including one of the most unique, and but wonderful, sex scenes in recent years."
    },
    {
      "text": "... Worthy of acclaim for its bold imagination, design and straddling of genres, as well as a heavy-weight cast, but it's perhaps more conventional than people might expect."
    },
    {
      "text": "A what-if story... What if The Creature from the Black Lagoon found love? What if Beauty and the Beast were set in Cold War USA?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The story falls into a pattern of contrived confrontations that culminates in an underwhelming union."
    },
    {
      "text": "Del Toro's story is built on a beautiful landscape brought to life by production design master Paul Austerberry and Dan Laustner, whose cinematography paints a pulpy noir coat of paint on a tumultuous period in American history."
    },
    {
      "text": "This beautifully crafted fantasy falls somewhere between del Toro's more personal Spanish-language films (like Pan's Labyrinth) and his American popcorn spectaculars."
    },
    {
      "text": "From the very first frame to the last, The Shape Of Water is a captivating and emotional experience."

      "text": "Guillermo del Toro has done it again."
    },
    {
      "text": "Simply beautifully enchanting and brutally mysterious, visually luscious and mesmerising, del Toro is a cinematic genius."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's the small, rather than the big, that impresses most here, and it proves a welcome return to the director's modest origins."
    },
    {
      "text": "Del Toro's \"fairy tale for troubled times\" has the limitations of even the best fairy tale, a lack of social concreteness and urgency, but its positive qualities are real."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water probably had inclusive goals in mind, but execution is everything."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's pleasant and pretty, the execution largely distracting from feeling that the script is something of a missed opportunity."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The Shape of Water\" never truly coalesces, handing viewers a collection of admirable parts but a whole that's left wanting."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is an enchanting escapism, in which Del Toro uses a visual display and sociopolitical parables in order to embellish romanticism in a film that honors the genres of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "A love story birthed by a pure love of cinema that's derivative as it is celebratory of its many inspirations."
    },
    {
      "text": "Something of a cinematic miracle -- the kind that Del Toro has given us over the years to the point where I'm starting to feel spoiled."
    },

      "text": "[W]ith The Shape of Water, one of our greatest storytellers has made his masterpiece."
    },
    {
      "text": "Art depends on a specific point of view. The Shape of Water is flawed, but there's no denying it's art."
    },

      "text": "The Shape of Water's visual, acoustic, and emotional fluidity transports us into an underwater world where we are free to breathe again."

      "text": "Once again, del Toro has raised the bar in his creativity and made an unconventional romance into a stunning fairy tale."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water lives and breathes such defiant romanticism it's hard not to swoon."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Guillermo del Toro] has directed Sally Hawkins in a remarkable performance telling this tale of love without saying one word in an elaborate production that is visual, imaginative and enthralling from beginning to end."
    },
    {
      "text": "Interestingly primed but never fully satisfying, The Shape of Water will enchant those inclined towards the film's romantic investments in one of Del Toro's most willfully rosy-tinted films concerning mankind."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like the best film monsters, it's difficult not to feel some sympathy for him. Because his spiritual rot born out of toxic masculinity began a long time ago and there's nothing he can do about it."
    },
    {
      "text": "In his greater films, del Toro is able to strike a balance between harsh violence and sentimentalism, but the alchemy doesn't necessarily work here."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a love story above all else, and on many different levels, and it's all just rather wonderful."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water juggles heart-wrenching tragedy, sharp-witted humor, and heartwarming brilliance. Del Toro has this personal understanding of flawed humans and eccentric creatures resulting in something magical and wondrous."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite its talented cast and stylistic veneer, the stranger-than-Stranger-Things feature is overhyped."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water is definitely worth a watch for its story and filmmaking prowess."
    },
    {
      "text": "The new Guillermo del Toro's film does not understand awards and nominations, but love, color, life and, in short, everything that makes the purest cinema magical. [Full Review in Spanish]"

    },
    {
      "text": "If The Shape of Water never quite breaks out of the confines of what's basically a tale as old as time, it's still an artfully executed diversion further strengthened by an excellent central performance by Hawkins."
    },
    {
      "text": "Passive furries may have helped The Beauty & The Beast become a global smash this year, but it's The Shape of Water\" that uses its interspecies, star-crossed lovers to actually say something."
    },
    {
      "text": "An aquatic beauty and the beast."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water is boring, uninspired and undeserving of the gallons of praise in which it currently splashes."
    },
    {
      "text": "This creature is cut, chiseled, virile; you'd be forgiven if you find yourself a little turned on."
    },
    {
      "text": "A gentle and heartrending reminder that being different doesn't mean having to live a life alone."
    },
    {
      "text": "The world of this fairy tale is not a magic kingdom but a world like ours that is muddy and contaminated and incongruous that resonates with the tinkling notes from an old piano."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anyone who has loved either old monster movies or the Beast in the fairy tale Beauty and the Beast will be charmed by this wonderful sci-fi fantasy of outsiders, insiders, and monsters in The Shape of Water."
    },
    {
      "text": "No no one else can make (our would make) a movie like this, except for [Guillermo del Toro]...One of the most unique films I've seen this year."
    },
    {
      "text": "Guillermo del Toro crafts a modern-day monster movie with a social conscience, a genre-mashup featuring a mix of old movies and musicals, vintage advertising, noir and good old-fashioned romance."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water takes us both somewhere nostalgic and unfamiliar."
    },
    {
      "text": "With welcome details in every frame, the set design and costumes speak their own language."
    },
    {
      "text": "The romance of cinema; the hopefulness of love; the struggle to feel whole, valid, and less lonely; the courage to fight for what's right & good in this terrible world."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the end, it's films that I connect with emotionally that I love and remember the most. This one is a masterpiece bear revisiting time and time again."

      "text": "Let yourself be hastened into this unforgettable water slide ride."
    },
    {
      "text": "While it still falls short of his earlier triumphs, it's a step in the right direction for the Hollywood expansion of del Toro's unique vision"
    },
    {
      "text": "If The Shape of Water were purely focused on Eliza and the creature with deity-like properties, it would be a pure shot of cinematic ecstasy."

    {
      "text": "Neil Gaiman once wrote that America is no place for gods. But is it no place for fairy tales? Guillermo del Toro would say no."
    },
    {
      "text": "An undeniably gorgeous film, bathed in a radiant, emerald glow and fully embracing its early '60s backdrop that allows it to take on an old-Hollywood aesthetic."
    },

      "text": "Want to see a movie that pulses with an abundance of pure creativity and vision? This is it."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Guillermo] del Toro's love of nostalgia gets in the way of moving the story forward. It has a familiarity that hinders the newness and excitement of the downright incredible moments of character."
    },
    {
      "text": "Del Toro hits another grand slam with the production design, but the movie really wins because of it's honest approach."
    },
    {
      "text": "With its art-deco gothic look and haunting score courtesy of Alexandre Desplat, The Shape of Water is one of the most unique films to come out this year."
    },
    {
      "text": "I didn't find this iteration of a familiar myth very effective or affecting. Maybe you'll love this frog prince more than I did."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water elevates beyond genre expectations... an unexpected, deeply personal adventure that will captivate any audience willing to give it a chance."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water may be the most stunning film I have ever seen. Visually, it draws you in with gorgeous creature design and fascinating use of colors. The performances are absolutely outstanding, and the characters are fascinating."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film does all feel rather insubstantial though and a touch 'second hand' by its final reel. Emotionally, visually and contextually it's all a little passé."
    },
    {
      "text": "Cinematic perfection at its purest."
    },
    {
      "text": "At its core, The Shape of Water is a film about being seen as a person without any asterisks."
    },
    {
      "text": "[Hawkins is] utterly mesmerizing to watch even in scenes where she's not attempting to seduce a man-phibian."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "These waters might run strongly, but they're far muddier than they should be."
    },
    {
      "text": "I am head over heels in love with Guillermo del Toro's latest picture."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water shows us that it's never too late to be understood or seen. Look beyond surfaces and see with your heart."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's about the way our sexuality reveals ourselves and how sex allows us to connect with others in meaningful ways. But mostly, it's about a woman f*cking a fish monster."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is a beautiful, evocative and captivating film, guaranteed to resonate with audiences old and young. Simply put, it is one of the best films of the year."

    },
    {
      "text": "A magical transcendence that makes you leave the cinema floating."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film proves that intentional ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean a story ends unsettled. That it doesn't explicitly tell you which interpretation to have makes all of them more powerful."
    },
    {
      "text": "If all we're going to get from del Toro now are on are R-rated films, then I would want them to all feel like this."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water is subversive without meaning to be political. It invites us to consider the strange, romantic pairing of its two main characters, and in challenging us with this vision, it challenges us to consider how we view each other."

    {
      "text": "Guillermo Del Toro, takes the story of this unlikely duo and makes it not only believable but sorrowful, lyrical, mystical, mythical, strange, and, well, magic."

      "text": "The pride Del Toro takes in his world-building, and the creation of his characters and monsters, is a sheer wonder that continues to amaze me. The Shape of Water is no different."
    },
    {
      "text": "As an actress who utters not a single word, Hawkins give a profound performance, creating a breathtaking understanding of her longing to be loved."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is so much to delight visually here as well as the beautiful and captivating film score. It's a striking masterpiece that flows just like water."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water may too obviously foreshadow how these characters will eventually collide violently and ideologically, but del Toro's pop storytelling remains so effortlessly jazzy and hypnotic that it hardly matters."
    },
    {
      "text": "The scenes underwater, specifically with Elisa and the Amphibious Man are mesmerizing and incredibly sensual; a beautiful fluidity with the motions of the characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "This movie, like its title, is extremely hard to define...it doesn't fit neatly in any genre...and it's best to let it wash over you."
    },
    {
      "text": "... has the seriousness and innocence of A Monster Calls while indulging in an R-rated adult fantasy romance, an amazing line to walk and all the better for it."
    },

    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "Such an out of the ordinary picture demands an unconventional heroine and del Toro could not have chosen better than Hawkins."
    },
    {
      "text": "The progressive agenda wins the Oscar! Love that! Wait, nope-I draw the line at interspecies carnality. When protesting persecution and lauding universal love, at least pick a metaphor not as universally reviled as bestiality. It's not twee, it's gross."
    },
    {
      "text": "As the title implies, this is a movie that surrounds the viewer's psyche and physical being. It is a film that achieves everything it sets out to accomplish."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film feels like a modern fable, with its characters almost bereft of grey areas, and its themes laid out without a hint of subtlety and laced with glorious lyricism."
    },
    {
      "text": "In this, del Toro asks \"what if the monster got the girl?\". It's a strange question with weird answers, but one he poses with beauty, delicacy and intelligence."

    },
    {
      "text": "Often morose, it livens up when Shannon is tasering the fishman or engaged in bloodletting and beatings. It is a kind of horror movie, it's true, but those scenes overpower the film's invocation of desperate forbidden love."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sally Hawkins delivers a performance of a lifetime...A visually stunning adventure that's part monster film, part romantic fable, and part Cold War thriller, The Shape of Water is a playground for some of Del Toro's favourite themes."

    },
    {
      "text": "For all its cosmic tingles, del Toro manages to smuggle a deeply personal film across Hollywood's border where, beneath its haunted charm, lies an immigrant's story rising to the surface, setting us adrift in a dream."

      "text": "The actors are in perfect harmony with the story and the emotional core is never lost thanks to a masterful interpretation by Sally Hawkins. [Full Review in Spanish]"

      "text": "If we can't believe in the characters, how are we supposed to care?"
    },
    {
      "text": "It sounds ridiculous, yet through some magical alchemy it works - magnificently so."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is made with the absolute, dead-centre sincerity of a child righting an ancient wrong, and the craft of a film-maker at the height of his powers. It is also unexpectedly kinky in ways that deepen it into something genuinely rich and strange."
    },
    {
      "text": "A beautiful homage to cinema, its moral is far from subtle, but Sally Hawkins's wonderful performance raises it from cute oddity to emotional journey."
    },
    {
      "text": "On the one hand, The Shape of Water plays out like a forgotten instalment of The Twilight Zone. On the other, it makes for an attractive date movie. Seriously, who'd have thought that something so bizarre could be so romantic?"
    },

      "text": "A film about films, and a lush Cold War melodrama involving an interspecies romance that should be creepy but isn't, Guillermo del Toro's Shape of Water is an unexpected and irresistible delight."

    },
    {
      "text": "The Shape of Water is the world as Guillermo del Toro sees it - full of injustice, but also, crucially, decency. Where others see pain, he sees hope, where others see fear, he sees compassion, where others see monsters, he sees friends."
