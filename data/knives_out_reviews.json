    },
    {
      "text": "It was one of 2019's best films, if only for the way it studies classicism in the genre that has always leaned on the lifestyles of the rich and the famous to mount its greatest mysteries."

    },
    {
      "text": "Knives Out does go on a bit longer and there are one too many running down corridors and driving from one place to another, but as a whole the film pays off with humor, mayhem, and shows us families to whom \"entitlement\" is their middle name."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rian Johnson kept the mood of the movie rather light and seemingly frivolous. But don't let that fool you, it's suspenseful when it needs to be and so delightfully entertaining. That last shot is one of the best cinematic final scenes ever!"
    },
    {
      "text": "While Knives Out doesn't have the weight of other Rian Johnson vehicles like Brick or Looper, one can tell the filmmaker is enjoying his time outside Star Wars."
    },

    },
