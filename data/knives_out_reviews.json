    },
    {
      "text": "It was one of 2019's best films, if only for the way it studies classicism in the genre that has always leaned on the lifestyles of the rich and the famous to mount its greatest mysteries."

    },
    {
      "text": "Knives Out does go on a bit longer and there are one too many running down corridors and driving from one place to another, but as a whole the film pays off with humor, mayhem, and shows us families to whom \"entitlement\" is their middle name."
    },
    {
      "text": "Rian Johnson kept the mood of the movie rather light and seemingly frivolous. But don't let that fool you, it's suspenseful when it needs to be and so delightfully entertaining. That last shot is one of the best cinematic final scenes ever!"
    },
    {
      "text": "While Knives Out doesn't have the weight of other Rian Johnson vehicles like Brick or Looper, one can tell the filmmaker is enjoying his time outside Star Wars."
    },
    {
      "text": "Johnson's writing can go from air-tight to crowded in how many figure eights it pulls like clockwork, sure, but it skips across its pond of suspects with grace."

    },
    {
      "text": "Rian Johnson's last movie was something called The Last Jedi, a trifle of a film which made little impact at the box office and generated no online reaction whatsoever."
    },
    {
      "text": "The classic whodunit mystery is reinvigorated in extraordinary style in writer-director Rian Johnson's Knives Out. It's the best film of its kind since 2001's Gosford Park."

    },
