    },
    {
      "text": "This is boring, and it's partly that believability thing. How many alienated outsiders do you have to gather together before they become insiders? Alternatively, they are all so good-looking, smart and well-heeled, they are winners, surely."

    {
      "text": "Seek out the infinitely superior The Myth of the American Sleepover for an original and moving take on similar material."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie has its moments of soap-opera excitement, but it has all the substance of a teenage strop, and none of the energy."

      "text": "Teenage wallflowers, past and present alike, will feel tingles of recognition, and pure pleasure."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's over-familiar stuff and the characters talk in pretentious teen speak (\"I feel infinite\") but scenes and characters linger in the memory."

      "text": "(The movie is) set in 1991, in a small town where high school culture is a John Hughes movie, with all the confusion, '80s music and hip ennui that implies."
    },
    {
      "text": "The real strength of the film though lies in its authenticity. There are many scenes, characters, details and interactions that you'll swear have been lifted from your very own adolescent years."
    },

    {
      "text": "It might not be a massive hit, but it will certainly ease a few paths through the awkwardness of adolescence."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its romance regarding the significance of teen experience might not work on everyone, but its earnestness, wit and stirring music ought to leave few hearts wholly untouched."
    },
    {
      "text": "An honest, affection-hooking, coming-of-age drama which proves that there is life beyond Hogwarts for Emma Watson."
    },
    {
      "text": "Watson holds her own with a character more annoying on paper than in reality, but it's the boys who most impress ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The freshest and most heartfelt teen-angst to come along since \"Easy A.\" (Stephen) Chbosky directs with sensitive confidence and wrings impressive work out of his young leads."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's an earnest indie about a troubled teen, Charlie (Logan Lerman), and his various troubled confederates -- but it does demonstrate that Watson can stand on her own."

    {
      "text": "Observe the white, middle-class American Catholic teenager in his natural habitat...Though we have, perhaps, never flaunted the fetching eyelashes and perfect skin of these curious creatures...have we not, in a sense, been there?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Ripe dramatic material, but Chbosky surrounds his hurting characters with the cinematic equivalent of a hug circle -- which is sweet, but rather antithetical to tension-building."
    },
    {
      "text": "An exploration of troubled teenagers as well as counter-cultural angst that, because of its commitment to the ugly side of truth, is rife with honesty and captivating drama."
    },
    {
      "text": "A muddled creation blessed with unique emotional sincerity, yet cursed with loose ends and poorly defined characters, huddled into a precious creation that might test the patience of those with a sensitivity to effusive teen melodrama."
    },
    {
      "text": "High school can be hell, but Stephen Chbosky's engaging new film argues that anyone can get by with a little help from their friends."
    },
    {
      "text": "Somehow, these imperfections fit. Somehow, \"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\" shouldn't be flawless."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie's perfectly understated, warts-and-all sense of time and place will send any suburban Gen Xer in the audience flashing right back to their less-cautious days, when mix tapes did heavy lifting as calling cards."
    },
    {
      "text": "This somewhat disjointed but refreshingly earnest movie ultimately establishes itself as a charmer."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is clearly a labor of love that was nurtured and sculpted from the beginning. The result is a film that feels exhilarating, fragile, funny and real."
    },

      "text": "Well-soaked in the familiar brine of teen sensitivity."
    },
    {

    },
    {
      "text": "Verbal play and smartass-ery weaves through Wallflower, but it's of the predictable variety rather than the wryly observant commentary we'd hope for, like when a bored teen drawls: \"That works on so many levels.\""

    },
    {
      "text": "I always root for these kids like this. You want them to fit in and have a good experience. It's what this movie does to you; it's so full of life and spirit but it can also get real dark in places. A lot like going on a date with Mark Ellis."

    },
    {
      "text": "While there are humorous and poignant moments, this angst-filled story of tender kisses, awkward dances, friends drifting apart, kindly English teachers, unrequited crushes and drug-addled partying has a nagging sense of deja vu."
