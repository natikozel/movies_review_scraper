      "text": "When you come right down to it, 'Tenet' is a mess. A gloriously shot, exquisitely staged mess with a thrilling final act - but still a mess."
    },
    {
      "text": "For those who don't want to engage with Nolan's academic exercises, just tune out and revel in its baser pleasures: thrilling spy set pieces and charismatic leads. The other stuff? Ain't nobody got time for that."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the end, \"Tenet\" isn't one of Nolan's most satisfying films. But after I've seen it four or five more times, maybe I'll change my mind."
