      "text": "...benefits strongly from O’Brien’s charismatic performance and a smattering of above-average action sequences..."
    },
    {
      "text": "A clearly told, broadly appealing, nicely creepy science fiction thriller."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite strong performances and a fascinating setup, it feels like a typical episode of Lost in which more questions are asked instead of answered—except here, there's no promise of a new episode next week."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner doesn't have the cheeriest of presentations, but the film is able to be its own thing. And, for dystopian young adult novel adaptations, that's saying a lot these days."
    },
    {
      "text": "Makes comments about the dangers of conformity and the virtues of bravery and loyalty and does appear to be headed into some twisty-turny territory should the next part of the story get made."

      "text": "Smarter than most, thematically interesting, and unique enough to make it stand out in a crowded landscape."
    },
    {
      "text": "Logic and any adherence to common sense falls to the wayside."
    },
    {
      "text": "As director Wes Ball builds the eeriness around the complex entrapment of a community of boys living a Lord Of The Flies type existence, he is ably aided by imaginative and well-executed production design and special effects."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite featuring a somewhat cliched narrative, Wes Ball's The Maze Runner delivers unusual attention to character and world development, producing unforeseen engagement and bringing new depth to a tired subgenre."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite its familiar tropes, the film boasts a strong cast, numerous heart-in-mouth action moments, and a truly terrifying monster... making it a solid and thoroughly enjoyable little adventure story."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's intriguing enough that I'm now anticipating the next installment, The Scorch Trials."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's as if you are watching a television show with a season-ending cliffhanger, but the difference is you have to wait more than a year."
    },
    {
      "text": "Without backstory it's impossible to care about these boys, so, instead of characters we can root for, we get archetypes."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a big difference between being mysterious and being ambiguous, but The Maze Runner seems to be under the impression that they're the same thing."
    },
    {
      "text": "In a field of YA fiction that relies heavily on cliches and Big Messages about Big Things, it's is a welcome change of pace that subverts more cliches than it adheres to."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sure, the movie is derivative and ends on a somewhat sour note. But following a long line of tepid popcorn flicks in 2014, The Maze Runner is more notable for what it does right than what it does wrong."

      "text": "...all the good done by the movie is destroyed by its incredibly generic and disappointing ending. [Full Review in Spanish]"

      "text": "Overall, The Maze Runner is a solid piece of science fiction that features an interesting story and some compelling visuals."
    },
    {
      "text": "The climax might seem underwhelming for some but the build-up is a sure-shot winner. Deserves a sequel..."
    },
    {
      "text": "This film, based on a best-selling young-adult novel, works so well because the story comes without the traits that viewers have come to associate with young-adult fiction."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner is a well told story in its own right, but many of the parts will be familiar. That said, this cross between the Lord of the Flies and The Hunger Games leaves you wanting more."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner isn't the birth or death of YA but rather, its extension. You travel through so many twists and tunnels only to end up exactly where you began."
    },
    {
      "text": "What will lift this series, from the mire of other Young Adult adaptations, will be less of a focus on style in favor of the substance underneath that surpasses matching jumpsuits and fancy team nicknames."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner is better and more tightly constructed than a simple cash-in. It's a well-paced adventure-thriller with an intoxicating sense of mystery and the chutzpah to take huge leaps with its fictional world."
    },
    {
      "text": "The adaptation of the book was an evident continuation for its success and in the film, we see, once again, a quick production: pretty by the promotional envelope and completely failed in the attempt of content. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "As 'yoof' films go... it's an entertaining watch and doesn't take too much investment."
    },
    {
      "text": "[\"The Maze Runner\"] never delivers on its early potential, quickly falling down a chute of one-note characters and painfully sparse storytelling."
    },
    {
      "text": "The real fun comes in navigating the puzzle, with solving it more the icing on top of a promising, multi-layered franchise cake."
    },
    {
      "text": "...neither as good as The Hunger Games nor as dull as the Divergent series, The Maze Runner has the same secret weapon utilized by MTV's Teen Wolf show: Dylan O'Brien."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wes Ball does a good job of establishing his world and making the maze an imposing place to spend time."
    },
    {
      "text": "A charismatic lead helps tamp down the more generic elements of the story of a young man forced to scour a seemingly-endless maze to find a way out for everyone trapped against their will."
    },
    {
      "text": "You get less than a full explanation at the end about what it all was about. Never mind, we already know that a sequel is on the way."
    },
    {
      "text": "A well-executed thriller and is certainly the best YA adaptation since the last 'Hunger Games' film."
    },
    {
      "text": "... may ultimately be a better film when examined in the context of its potential successors, but taken on its own, it's a puzzling tease."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's briskly-paced, well acted and action packed. And as this is mostly a boys-only affair, we don't get bogged down by a tiresome romance."
    },
    {
      "text": "Shows an impressive turn of speed in places but runs out of puff before the finishing line."
    },
    {
      "text": "One of the best of the current spate of Young Adult novel-inspired dystopian teen dramas..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner generally has ambitious production values, is well edited and boasts a thumping score. Think of it as Lord Of the Flies meets Alien."
    },
    {
      "text": "It does provide flawed-but-fun entertainment for a young male audience, a la some kind of Dude-vergent."
    },
    {
      "text": "Generally redeemed by feature first-timer Wes Ball's forthright action sequences."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whither post-apocalyptic young adult sci-fi? With two movies to go, Hunger Games already feels overly familiar."
    },
    {
      "text": "A sub-par YA adaptation that gets too bogged down in its own mechanics to adequately establish compelling characters or drama."
    },
    {
      "text": "Trying desperately to focus on the themes of free will, responsibility and death (several major characters have a gruesome fate), all I could think about was cheap vodka."
    },
    {
      "text": "The dynamics of the group and the mystery of what is really going on are enough to sustain the momentum of The Maze Runner."
    },
    {
      "text": "The latest in a long line of teen fantasies, The Maze Runner is a cagey dystopian thriller that tries to make a virtue of its limitations but becomes samey and tedious after a while."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the annals of dystopian young-adult franchises, The Maze Runner is less than totes amazeballs."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's nothing particularly original or insightful to set this teen-dystopia thriller apart from the crowd, but strong characters will build some anticipation for the next instalment in the franchise."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Hunger Games meets Lord of the Flies in this fast-paced and enjoyably moody teen thriller adapted from the bestselling novel by James Dashner."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's Lord Of The Flies meets Lost, but in a good way."
    },
    {
      "text": "Yet more celibate chiselled hotties in some ritualised game-playing future world, who discover that they are in some super-special way different, or divergent, or exceptional."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a well-made adventure with great energy and considerable style, but it's essentially a maze without an exit."
    },
    {
      "text": "Utter garbage. The kids will love it."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may not quite a-Maze you, but for its fanbase, it will no doubt be a Runner-way hit."
    },
    {
      "text": "[I haven't] read any of the books but was gripped from the get-go ..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Bland and generic beyond the small pleasures of its theme-park-ride-esque thrills and its half-intriguing, half-infuriating mystery."
    },
    {
      "text": "There remains a lot of potential in here for future productions, particularly given the credentials of the cast on board."
    },
    {
      "text": "Teenagers are getting it in the neck again, in the latest dystopian Young Adult literary sensation to get the Hollywood treatment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Amassing tension ahead of a solid pay-off, it'll leave you hungry for the next installment."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner moves at a reasonably enjoyable pace, taking us from CGI-heavy set-piece to set-piece and only occasionally stumbling."
    },
    {
      "text": "Dystopia is no cakewalk, but apparently it's going to be especially hard on teenagers."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's all familiar territory, but it's realized with flair."
    },
    {
      "text": "A solid B-movie version of the big YA franchises, less pretentious and glossy."
    },
    {
      "text": "A movie so utterly joyless that it makes all recent fantasies about young adults trapped in shattered worlds look like excursions through Mr. Roger's Neighborhood."
    },
    {
      "text": "They're good-looking young people in a futuristic dystopia. They could change their future if only they could remember something. They live primitive lives and must vie against a largely unseen foe."
    },
    {
      "text": "An improvement over run-of-the-mill movies of its type. The screenplay is generally intelligent, characters are surprisingly well-defined, and the acting is above average."
    },
    {
      "text": "[The ending is] an overly complicated and confusing turn of events that raises more questions than it answers-frustrating in a flick that's nearly all mystery."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner is a slickly plot-driven flick that delivers the basic sense of adventure that is sometimes missing from its relentlessly brooding cinematic progenitor."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film is fine as long as the maze remains a mystery. When those nutty explanations arrive at the end, it all falls apart."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner is a terrific mystery adventure that employs that wonderful, age-old technique of putting you at one with the characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a version of this story that has some keen insights on the formation of traditions and taboos... but The Maze Runner does not come within leagues of being that version."
    },
    {
      "text": "I think I have a touch of apocalepsy -- excessive sleepiness caused by prolonged exposure to three- and four-part series in which adolescents rebel against oppressive governments represented by esteemed actors."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is an underlying clash of philosophies that is as compelling in its all but subliminal presentation as the dashes through the maze, and the revelations, which come thick and fast"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner might seem at first to have echoes of Lord Of The Flies, with its community of boys forced to survive in the wild. But it seems to have ingredients of a World War II POW movie, of The Great Escape or Stalag 13."
    },
    {
      "text": "The increasing sameness of these films (an evil future society, a young hero/heroine who must both confront the authorities and escape from them) is becoming pretty familiar."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Ball's direction is confident and some of the performances are strong, the movie itself is laden with exposition and terminology and doesn't really pick up steam until halfway through the movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's not that The Maze Runner represents anything like \"the death of cinema,\" but it crosses the Rubicon into utter exhaustion. All the more depressing that the film itself is mostly very good."
    },
    {
      "text": "The special effects and the mystery of their surroundings are sufficient for sustaining interest."
    },
    {
      "text": "It never captured my fancy or had much depth."
    },
    {
      "text": "I smell popcorn. I smell franchise."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner leans heavily on its premise, to the detriment of individual characters, but still succeeds as one of Hollywood's better young adult adaptations."
    },
    {
      "text": "Is the true enemy this all-testosterone Lord of the Flies clan? Nah, faulting your fellow kids is so 1950s. For the millennials, adults gotta be to blame"
    },
    {
      "text": "The bad news is that this is not the next Hunger Games. The good news is that it's no Divergent either."
    },
    {
      "text": "Having not read the book, I was hoping for a more satisfying payoff than the one I got. Then again, maybe the filmmakers are saving the answers for the sequel."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner's story only really works if viewers live in the moment and react to the characters' immediate and intense fears and trials, rather than analyzing the situation that produced them."
    },
    {
      "text": "In the wasteland of the near-future, anyone can rise to greatness. Every kid with a BA in History is a budding regional warlord, every barista a potential Master or Blaster."
    },
    {
      "text": "One could wish the picture were less thematically anemic...but there's something to be said for the nifty concept and pure adrenaline, when it kicks in."
    },
    {
      "text": "For its first five minutes, The Maze Runner succeeds in drawing you into its strange world. Sadly, it never gets better than that kinetic opening, and it quickly becomes a bore to look at and a chore to sit through."
    },
    {
      "text": "Dystopian tale offers high-stakes action, mystery for teens."
    },
    {
      "text": "Another shaky-cam dystopian fable based on some godforsaken YA novel? No, thank you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Dark, dangerous and uncommonly thrilling, The Maze Runner is that rarest and most satisfying of series starters - one that keeps you on the edge of your seat and leaves you eagerly awaiting the next installment."
    },
    {
      "text": "I'm on board with finding out what happens next. Can there be a bigger compliment?"
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner is clever, absorbing and good for both teens and parents -- until that silly reveal."
    },
    {
      "text": "There are only three maze sequences in the movie... Were there more maze runs in the book? Worse, the latter maze runs are largely green screen affairs."
    },
    {
      "text": "Comes from a teen-focused post apocalyptic book. They call it speculative fiction. I call it much less than a MAZE ing."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner is a superior entry in Hollywood's onslaught of adolescents versus future dystopia films. It's interesting, well acted, well directed, and delivers a highly original outcome."
    },
    {
      "text": "The young cast as a whole is an engaging group who elevate a simple story into something that stands out from the pack of YA adaptations."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner is a surprisingly solid movie, and its fans should generate enough interest to keep the series running."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie whets the viewer's appetite, and then offers up nothing but loose ends and strained credulity."
    },
    {
      "text": "Frantic yet utterly familiar sci-fi fantasy, filled with twists and turns."
    },
    {
      "text": "Have we reached dystopia overload yet?"
    },
    {
      "text": "There's no denying the film has a unique concept that works quite well for it. (Full Content Review for Parents also available)"
    },
    {
      "text": "The premise seems both smart and intriguing, but the film directed by Wes Ball bears many of the cruder markings of YA fiction."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's bleak business, and as it hurries toward its explosive, expository conclusion, the film becomes nonsensical, too."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ball's film might be derivative, but it's also intense and entertaining enough to leave audiences hungry for the inevitable sequel so clearly set up by its cliffhanger ending."
    },
    {
      "text": "It presumes nothing and works hard to make us respect it, a sign of good filmmaking first and franchise building second."
    },
    {
      "text": "A handsomely-made film is ultimately undone by its own too-silly sci-fi storyline and script leaping off the screen and running madly off in all directions."
    },
    {
      "text": "With some good acting performances, some very horror-movie sensibilities, a good mystery and a solid dystopian aesthetic, The Maze Runner trilogy is off to a great start."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anyone looking for an escapist ride through a post-apocalyptic landscape might have fun mapping this latest experiment in mass marketing and source -material-to-potential-audience ratios."
    },
    {
      "text": "The inevitable sequel may sort out some of this mess. In the meantime, filmmakers beware: When your story is called The Maze Runner, it's got to be pretty hard not to write yourself into a corner."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film relies too much on the power of its mystery to keep us entertained. But the deeper we go with the Maze Runner, the less interesting his story becomes."
    },
    {
      "text": "Constructed as a mystery, its various layers gradually unpeeling with each new discovery, the film eschews a lot of early exposition in exchange for a deliberate build-up. This first installment is certainly promising enough to warrant a continuation."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a film that thrives on its mystery. It's a pretty good one, too..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Packed with thrills, daring surprises and compelling performances, this is no mere 'Hunger Games' imitator. 'The Maze Runner' sprints to the finish line at the forefront of the YA franchises ready to take the baton from Katniss and company."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you are looking for the next HUNGER GAMES, this isn't near to that level, but you could do worse."
    },
    {
      "text": "It may not be the next \"Hunger Games\" but this new adaptation of a young adult novel offers enough to keep viewers enthralled."
    },
    {
      "text": "A worthy addition to the genre, an absorbing drama with surprising turns and even more surprising resonance to contemporary conflicts."
    },
    {
      "text": "It feels like a teen rip-off of Lost, and that's no bad thing for a while."
    },
    {
      "text": "Makes room for a crummy ending that's not content to give ticket buyers their money's worth, but demand they immediately save up for sequel."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite the film's title, not enough time is spent in the maze itself, and its mysteries, as well as who created it and forced these boys to try to survive within it, are barely touched on until the end."
    },
    {
      "text": "Teens should eat up this fantasy's scenery-chewing angst and doom, and the hopeful tale of survival and empowerment (to be continued in the inevitable sequel or sequels)."
    },
    {
      "text": "A well-acted and intelligent thriller/futuristic sci-fi romp."
    },
    {
      "text": "The maze is intriguing, the creatures are terrifying and the action scenes are of the \"stuff whipping around and moving so fast it's hard to tell what's going on\" variety. But, when the maze's mysteries are unlocked... it feels like a cheat."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite a strong opening and riveting first 45 minutes, The Maze Runner devolves into one of the weakest post-apocalyptic Young Adult movies to reach theaters in recent years."
    },
    {
      "text": "Much of The Maze Runner feels not like a post-apocalyptic action fantasy but an out-and-out horror film."
    },
    {
      "text": "Director Wes Ball and his outstanding young cast work unusually hard to counter the derivative feel."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's burdened with banal dialogue and a laughably dumb endgame that squeezes the life out of its superior parts."
    },
    {
      "text": "Gets the vision and the grit of the source material but finally feels more like a long trailer than an involving movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "By keeping its cards so close, \"The Maze Runner\" remains compelling."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ball has created balance between a thin but solid script and first-rate action -- and he doesn't waste a frame doing it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Ball is deft, though, at evoking claustrophobia of every kind, whether in the open-air prison of the Glade or the actual tight spaces of the Maze. And he elicits a hair-trigger performance from O'Brien."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The Maze Runner,\" as a film, is free of texture, nuance, or dimensionality. And those wishing for the kind of visceral excitement and subtle socio-political commentary of \"The Hunger Games\" will be found desperately wanting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Everything looks great, from the cast to the setting to the beasties, and the pacing gives the characters room to live and breathe."
    },
    {
      "text": "It essentially just leads us into another maze but it feels like running into a brick wall. That's entertainment?"
    },
    {
      "text": "\"The Maze Runner\" isn't based on a video game, but you could be forgiven for thinking otherwise."
    },
    {
      "text": "A mostly entertaining adventure that plays like \"Lord of the Flies\" meets \"Cube\" meets an intelligent design lecture."
    },
    {
      "text": "Sure, \"The Maze Runner\" unravels a few mysteries, but it spins even more. Thomas, as it happens, isn't the only one dying of curiosity here. As the closing credits roll, you likely will be, too."
    },
    {
      "text": "Its entire running time is devoted to setup for a payoff that never arrives."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though it sometimes feels calculated and mechanical, it's also solid, well crafted and entertaining."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a DIY feel to The Maze Runner that's mildly refreshing; you can imagine kids trying this at home."
    },
    {
      "text": "Is there room at the multiplex for yet another entry in the young adult/dystopia/survival genre? Those who hunger for more could do worse than \"The Maze Runner,\" based on the first book in James Dashner's trilogy."
    },
    {
      "text": "Wes Ball's film version of the popular young-adult novel by James Dashner never makes much sense. Perhaps it would make more if you have read the book, but until they start handing out free copies before the movie starts, that cannot be a requirement."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like Jean-Paul Sartre's No Exit-tentialism, but more crowded and with the musk of bottled-up testosterone."
    },
    {
      "text": "The writers seem to have been reared in the \"Lost\" school of storytelling, happy to pile on three more questions for every answer."
    },
    {
      "text": "A sci-fi thriller set in a vaguely post-apocalyptic future must create a fully drawn universe to thoroughly captivate the viewer. But Maze Runner feels only partially formed."
    },
    {
      "text": "Though hardly a champion-quality entrant in this crowded YA field, it crosses the finish line winded but game."
    },
    {
      "text": "Given that a grandiose premise underpins the entire story, it's unfortunate just how bloodless this entire film (read: setup for parts two and three) actually is."
    },
    {
      "text": "What's intriguing about \"The Maze Runner\"-for a long time, at least-is the way it tells us a story we think we've heard countless times before but with a refreshingly different tone and degree of detail."
    },
    {
      "text": "The overall production design - including the opening titles - looks a lot more like TV than a feature film."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a pleasantly low-fi, bare-bones kind of storytelling here, at least before the movie's mysteries are boringly explained - another apocalypse to parse."
    },
    {
      "text": "A curious blend of our newly acquired taste for dystopia alongside a healthy sprinkling of Lord of the Flies, the film offers familiar pleasures without prompting the sense of having already been here before."
    },
    {
      "text": "I was quite riveted."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like too many big-screen treatments of best-selling dystopian novels, you half-watch it while thinking about when fall TV comes back and what to eat for dinner."
    },
    {
      "text": "The Maze Runner bucks the conventions of its genre by functioning as a pure cliffhanger machine, fueled by mystery instead of melodrama."
