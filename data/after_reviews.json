    {
      "text": "This really is a dumpster fire of a movie, so please save your money for something more worthwhile."
    },
    {
      "text": "After is also one of those teen dramas where every emotion has to be underscored by a pop-song and a hair is never out of place."
    },
    {
      "text": "Adapted from young adult fan fiction, not much happens in this adolescent love story, yet it becomes weirdly interesting."
    },
    {
      "text": "Of such deficient quality that it's unfathomable people will actually pay for a ticket to see this."
    },
    {
      "text": "The music is fun and the scenery is beautifully cinematic, in a way, but the story itself is neither."
    },
    {
      "text": "Jenny Gage's sudsy After offers run-of-the-mill college romance targeted to the PG-13 demographic. The result, a far cry from the lustier stories upon which it is based, misses the mark despite an appealing performance from Josephine Langford."
    },
    {
      "text": "The leads give it all they've got, and Australian actress Josephine Langford is impressive given the limited range of her role. The film looks pretty and director Jenny Gage, to her credit, knows the rhythms of teen melodrama well."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a movie well made for its target audience."
    },
    {
      "text": "After makes 50 Shades Of Grey look like Anna Karenina."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film's illogical choices and standard teen romance mentality mean nothing that transpires on screen feels remotely fresh."
    },
    {
      "text": "The first movie adaptation, and it looks fairly safe to say there won't be any more Afters after this After."
    },
    {
      "text": "The key to the book's success lies in its artful amateurism. It replicates the tone of one teen confiding in another and in this anodyne screen translation, its intimacy is lost."
    },
    {
      "text": "Where are the real teen romances? This gives us a hint, but the script is so flawed that it's hard to buy anything the characters do."
    },
    {
      "text": "...an often aggressively generic scenario..."

    {
      "text": "A lost opportunity. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "Full of light, pastel colors, enormous curtains, [a] bubble bath, and loud breathing while Taylor Swift plays. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The performances are spotty and half-hearted, even the most serious of lines are laughable."
    },
    {
      "text": "Anna Todd's novel adaptation is this generation's Cruel Intentions. The PG-13 rating holds back the story some, but stars Josephine Langford and Hero Fiennes Tiffin have impeccable chemistry."
    },
    {
      "text": "As assumed, After is remarkably horny and corny to the point of embarrassment."

      "text": "I endured [the film until the end only because of professional duty. [Full review in Spanish]"

      "text": "Films like After aren't necessarily the best kinds of films to talk to teenagers about sex. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "It just...lingers, futilely praying that the leads can wring something out of this material."
    },
    {
      "text": "Because the cast is good and the movie is directed with a certain level of energy, we're never necessarily bored, just wondering when it will stop behaving."
    },
    {
      "text": "Gage's tepid teen romancer After plays it safe and never elevates this youth-oriented, pseudo-steamy sudser beyond its pedestrian pauses of passion. One has seen this slushy session of teen sexual angst numerous times before, folks."
    },
    {
      "text": "When the back-story of how a movie came to be ends up being more interesting than the finished product, that isn't going to help matters. (Full Content Review for Parents - Sex, Profanity, etc. - also Available)"
    },
    {
      "text": "The real problem with After is that it's a lifeless slog of thinly written clichés, one that's missing the charismatic spark of the actual One Direction boys."
    },
    {
      "text": "A film for fans of the literary saga, but even they might wind up disappointed. [Full Review in Spanish]"

    },
    {
      "text": "Think Romeo and Juliet sans the poor outcome."
    },
    {
      "text": "After is an intimate look at the ups and downs of first love that takes some nonsensical narrative turns, but is nevertheless a captivating romance."
    },
    {
      "text": "The kind of dispiriting effort that thinks it's scratching an itch for masochistic young girls, but primarily suggests that romance, desire and sexuality aren't worth genuinely exploring."
    },
    {
      "text": "The soundtrack rounds up the accumulation of clichés that characterizes the entire film. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "The problems may lie in Todd's novel, but regardless, characters act illogically, as though written by someone who napped through most of Intro to Psych and skipped English 101 altogether."
    },
    {
      "text": "After opens with some narration about how certain moments in life seem to define a person, and from there, the clichés pretty much don't stop."
    },
    {
      "text": "An uninspired picture that lives at the intersection of E.L. James, Nicholas Sparks, and the Freeform network."
    },
    {
      "text": "An innocuous teen pulp soap opera that flirts with \"danger\" but, in fact, keeps surprising you with how mild and safe and predictable it turns out to be."
    },
    {
      "text": "A patina of high literature... is not enough to counteract the banality and insubstantiality of After. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "This film is closer to Twilight that the perfect comedy of manners from Austen or the romantic tragedy from Brontë. [Full Review in Spanish]"
