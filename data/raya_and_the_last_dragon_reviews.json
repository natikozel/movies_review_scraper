    {
      "text": "Boasting a predominantly Asian-American cast delivering exceptional voice work, Raya and the Last Dragon follows a partially disappointing, formulaic narrative but compensates it with stunning animation, a chill-inducing score, and quite a nice ending."
    },
    {
      "text": "A mess both in ideals and execution, the film fails to have the charm and poignance it presents and has to be seen as a rare failure for modern Disney animated features."

      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon is a visually striking spectacle with equally effective emotional resonance and a lively lead – in short, another win for Walt Disney Animation Studios."
    },
    {
      "text": "Disney films are no stranger to heavy stuff, but this film really seemed willing to grapple with some more complicated ideas even if it doesn’t quite have the nerve to see it through to the end."
    },
    {
      "text": "“Raya” has a story pulsating with urgency. It uses its fantastical setting, cultural inspirations, and enormous heart to encourage us to keep our faith in humanity, to trust one another, and to come together as a people."

      "text": "Never anything but captivating. A visual beauty and a new kick-ass princess for fans of Disney too."
    },
    {
      "text": "While Disney has been getting slowly better about including a variety of characters and cultures, they are still stuck far in the past on creative storytelling. 'Raya' reads like an '80s-era video game."

      "text": "It's so similar to pretty much everything Disney has put out in the last decade that it feels awfully repetitive."
    },
    {
      "text": "The motivations and agendas of the warring characters were nicely complex which is rare for an animated feature. Awkwafina does quite funny if anachronistically contemporary voice work as the dragon. Yet something about it felt soulless."

    },
    {
      "text": "...top drawer Disney, it's a thoughtful, nimble riposte to the brainless slug-fests that most family films descend into, and it's a self-aware, open-minded slice of world-building that should open the doors for a new franchise..."

      "text": "You won't be able to take your eyes off of \"Raya and the Last Dragon' with the beautiful palette of colors that make this Disney film pop off screen. The storyline doesn't break ground but women as the heroes and villains make it all the more interesting."

    },

      "text": "The story, the dialogue, the voicework and animation are all of the highest caliber. Not only are the visuals imaginative and gorgeous but there are life lessons to be learned about trust and selflessness and taking chances."

      "text": "Something amazing was created in spite of everything working against it, both mirroring and informing Raya's story, a plea for trust and an inclusive celebration of differences... emotional, entertaining, and powerful."

      "text": "A triumph of design held back by a lackluster story..."
    },

      "text": "In its more fantastical moments ... [it] hits the same flights of fancy as Studio Ghibli, but its separate elements never quite combine in the right way to make it a true Disney gem."
    },
    {
      "text": "I may be more forgiving of a few missteps due to the limited large-scale cinematic experiences allowed by this last year, but \"Raya and the Last Dragon\" was a delight."

      "text": "Even if the ground splinters underfoot during a cluttered climax, a Disney-grade message of unity against division firmly anchors the stirring aftermath."

    {
      "text": "It's pure formula, but on the whole, it's a reasonably diverting family-friendly showcase for Disney's characteristic blend of humor, heart and artistry."
    },
    {
      "text": "Certainly pitched well within the Disney formula - a princess-based tale of heroism - but it's also a monster step up in epic scale and action spectacle."
    },
    {
      "text": "Creating a better world is not a solo venture; it takes a village. Raya and the Last Dragon is freshly inclusive, lush and adventurous."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya isn't groundbreaking; she's even better. Raya is the new norm."
    },
    {
      "text": "[I]ts tale of a young woman (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) going on a quest is blandly formulaic, although the action scenes are lively."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya's storyline is beat-for-beat, a traditional Disney story, but its nuances are what make it stand out."
    },
    {
      "text": "Unlike Disney's dreary live-action update of Mulan, the studio's latest animation epic Raya and the Last Dragon makes a virtue of its female-fronted cast of characters..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's simplistic in its depiction of \"heroes\" and \"villains\" to the point where it feels more like a cheap Saturday morning cartoon than a rich animated feature."
    },
    {
      "text": "...merely serviceable..."
    },
    {
      "text": "The combination of action, drama, sentimentality and wackiness isn't always smooth, but the film looks so good, and the characters are so vivid, that it's easy to enjoy the ride."
    },
    {
      "text": "Albeit messy, Raya is a wonderment, most notably in its quieter observed moments that touch on grief, determination and companionship."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Raya and the Last Dragon\" has the laughs and tear-jerker moments we've come to expect and love but tries for more and succeeds on a supremely fun scale."
    },

      "text": "A fun and epic adventure full of magic that's effective thanks to its dazzling animation and its powerful and touching message. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon might be conventional in its storytelling, but the stunning animation, lovely characters, beautiful music, and heartfelt messages won me over in the end."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and The Last Dragon provide spectacular performances from Kelly Marie Tran and Awkwafina, but will encourage conversations about trust, forgiveness, courage and fear,. Global leaders could take notes form this animated lesson for sure"
    },
    {
      "text": "It proves to be a joyful fantasy adventure."
    },
    {
      "text": "The message is that you have to put aside differences and learn to trust and find common ground. It feels like it's hitting the right notes, with spectacular visuals."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie's trust-your-enemies theme is so insipid I'm surprised Woodrow Wilson isn't credited as one of the writers, although just about everybody else is (it took eight people to come up with this sludgy story)."
    },
    {
      "text": "There's a darkness here that I think is lacking in a lot of modern Disney films, and I respect that its message isn't just \"believe in yourself.\""
    },
    {
      "text": "It has a lot of great and touching moments, wonderful animation and some great performances, but it's derivative as can be... When it's not working, it is exasperating. But when it gets back on track, it's very rewarding."
    },
    {
      "text": "It stumbles on and on and on with a lot of things you've seen before... It struck me more as a corporate product than a story that someone really wanted to tell."
    },
    {
      "text": "Disney's animators once again create a stunning, detailed world of magical creatures and engaging characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "With Awkwafina taking on the role of the 'last dragon,' this sweet and sour mix of Mulan, Lassie and Avengers finds a wackiness that lets it float over the sea of cliche that washes over the screen from the first few computer-generated frames."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is a hopeful adventure, accompanied by absolutely beautiful visual power, bursting with splendid animated style and colourful absorbing spirit."
    },
    {
      "text": "Seeing it on screen cracked something in me that needed cracking, especially after this last year. I hope it does the same for you."
    },
    {
      "text": "Moments into the film we are reminded of Disney's consistent ability to produce stellar animation..."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Raya and the Last Dragon,\" is so affecting and candid about failure and the faith required for second chances that you could be forgiven for forgetting that it's a movie about a girl attempting to save her mystical realm by locating a dragon."
    },
    {
      "text": "The latest feature from Walt Disney Studios Animation is a rousing quest picture, somehow riffing on both Avengers: Endgame and Mulan..."
    },
    {
      "text": "I left the cinema thinking that the world is not quite like it is at the end of this movie, but we might all be happier if it was."
    },
    {
      "text": "Awkwafina leads a lively voice cast in a visually arresting adventure."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon boasts an all-Asian cast, breathtaking visuals, and a beloved Star Wars icon at its center."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is a complete package with something for everyone. It's a spirited fantasy adventure for the children, an inspiring young warrior princess, who defines women empowerment and a universally binding emotional fabric."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon is fun, it's action-packed, it's visually stunning, and it has a beautiful message of trust and community."
    },
    {
      "text": "The film draws you into its exciting spell, as well as its heroine, from the beginning. [Full review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Kelly Marie Tran brought a strong heroine to life so wonderfully as a multi-layered character. There is something universal about Raya and her purposeful journey that should appeal to anyone of all ages, regardless of ethnicity and background."
    },
    {
      "text": "The animation in this film is exquisite, using light and vivid colors to create an almost photo-like quality. Plus, it delivers a message of trust and cooperation that resonates today."
    },
    {
      "text": "This is easily Disney's most adult movie since its first renaissance, often evoking the bleaker spirit of Mulan and The Hunchback of Notre Dame..."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya works so well because of its success in the world-building department ... We are transported on a quest of mythical proportions, one that moves quickly, but still allows us plenty of moments to soak in the message and appreciate the details."
    },
    {
      "text": "There is an incandescence and a buoyancy to the animation that elevates the formula."
    },
    {
      "text": "The movie crosses the finish line on the strength of its cast, style and music; you won't have a bad time."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon is watchable and surrounded in rich traditions and intriguing folklore, but mediocre in its execution..."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's a fun, if slightly derivative, fantasy story with gorgeous animation."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon is a truly stunning piece of animation."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon reminds us how memories of those we've lost still strengthen and guide us in times of need."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Raya and the Last Dragon\" is another gem in the Disney canon."
    },
    {
      "text": "With the always funny Awkwafina offering her rock-solid vocal accompaniment, Sisu becomes the genuine scene-stealing star of this pretty piece."
    },
    {
      "text": "It more than qualifies itself as a new Disney masterpiece, a surprisingly mature exploration of grief and loss that's also a total sensory experience."
    },
    {
      "text": "The vocal characterizations courtesy of Awkwafina and Tran lend so much skillfully wrought feeling to the material, the movie's occasional bumps don't much matter."
    },
    {
      "text": "The most acutely neither-here-nor-there, going-through-the-motions mediocrity that [Disney is] capable of... it is, at least, sublimely gorgeous."
    },
    {
      "text": "The sparky characters, slick animation and breezy (and entirely bloodless) fight scenes transport us to a beautifully realised fantasy realm."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Raya and the Last Dragon\" is Disney through-and-through."
    },
    {
      "text": "Kumandra is coloured with the arts, myths and cultures of various Southeast Asian countries. But it's a love letter to the region more interested in summarising them through a Hollywood lens, rather than depicting an authentic version of any one country."
    },
    {
      "text": "Such sorrowful yearning dominates, even obscuring the colorful, dangerous, and always stunningly beautiful world."
    },
    {
      "text": "It is street food, dressed up restaurant-style. It is cleaner and less likely to cause offence, but it is no longer street food."
    },

      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon proved that it was more than just an adventure film by being able to bring weighty themes and fun action beats together in a fun way."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya herself is a wonderful protagonist, easily one of my favorite Disney princesses by a mile... By the time I was near the end, however, the film's innumerable borrowed tropes really began to get to me."
    },
    {
      "text": "It's also the best kind of feminist film in that it's one that doesn't clobber you with the message. Raya is allowed to be awesome without the script shouting about it all the time and it's better for it."
    },
    {
      "text": "Like Sisu, Raya and the Last Dragon's heart is absolutely in the right place, even if that's one of the few perfect parts. It could have been great. Instead, it's fine."

      "text": "The animation is gorgeous... It's got a great story... It's something the whole family can enjoy."
    },
    {
      "text": "The dialogue has more to do with 2021 than any mythical past, but Raya emerges as a visually imaginative and involving piece of animated entertainment."
    },
    {
      "text": "Raya and the Last Dragon isn't great because it's a glittery story of female empowerment that shows young girls that they can grow up to be heroes, too. It's great simply because it never expected them to be anything else."
    },
    {
      "text": "The deeper message, however, involves the toll that division and distrust inflicts on a mythical kingdom, which gives the otherwise pretty-good movie a rather timely hook."
    },
    {
      "text": "The whole film is gorgeous to revel in with how they brought a fantasy world to life while honoring Asian culture and tradition."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "Because this is a Disney animated film, the visuals and the story are top-notch. Is it a completely perfect movie? No ... Any of the movie's minor flaws are far outweighed by this captivating story that is sure to inspire repeat viewings."

      "text": "Mostly successful, with standout animation, outstanding world building, and engaging characters. It's not a Disney classic by any means, but it works."
    },
    {
      "text": "As full of action and derring-do as the movie is, the film's message is less about conflict and more about conflict resolution, with a refreshingly contemporary focus on female friendships."

    },
    {
      "text": "It's her flawed nature that makes Raya the most compelling, most sympathetic and most layered Disney princess in the company's long history - and what makes Raya and the Last Dragon the best Disney animated feature in many years."
    },
    {
      "text": "\"Raya and the Last Dragon\" could have been a new Disney classic-in-the-making if not for the movie's lack of originality and decision of playing safe with the formula."

But when sinister monsters known as the Druun threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity.
