      "text": "Midsommar is ambitious, well-acted, meticulously crafted, and thematically strong, but it fails at being what it’s supposed to be: a scary movie."
    },

      "text": "All you need to know going into this transgressive (if surrealistic) film is that it covers: animal abuse, cannibalism, incest, suicide, matricide, homicide, and some serious fucking.\n\nMy work here is done.\n\nGet thee thinking cap on."
    },
    {
      "text": "Midsommar is packed with reminders that if a film succeeds in depicting the darkness within vividly, then a sunshine-y environment can make the experience even more unnerving. Because viewers have nowhere to hide."
    },
    {
      "text": "In this immersive, subtle and unsettling horror master-work, Ari Aster takes his audience by the hand, and slowly and surely introduces the disturbing beneath the festive, relaxing and innocent."
    },
    {
      "text": "If you’re searching for a memorable breakup film—summer love rarely lasts—look no further than what Ari Aster offers here. Better yet, Midsommar would also make for quite a bonding experience when watched with a date…"
    },
    {
      "text": "Sure, it has just as much to say about our ignorance toward other cultural rituals (using Swedish folklore), but as a horror film about a failing relationship, Midsommar kind of broke me."
    },
    {
      "text": "…’Get on with it’ would be a more appropriate title for Ari Aster’s glacially slow horror film, a follow up to Hereditary that repeats many of the same dread-inducing tropes but with a remarkable drop-off in terms of effect…."

    {
      "text": "The performances from Florence Pugh and Jack Reynor are extraordinary, with both carrying two halves of Asters heart and reality."
    },
    {
      "text": "As in his previous film, the familiar, spiritual and ritual outside the social canons of normativity will be present, as well as the horror genre fused with drama and mystery in that peculiar poetics that seems to characterize this autor."
    },
    {
      "text": "Whether you love it or hate it, Midsommar is memorable. Florence Pugh carries the story on her shoulders with an astonishingly compelling performance, but her supporting cast didn't do much with their underdeveloped characters."
    },
    {
      "text": "What’s particularly remarkable is the feeling of dread that Aster is able to sustain over most of Midsommar’s two-hour-plus running time. This despite the fact that virtually the entire story unfolds under sunny skies."

    },
    {
      "text": "I did not like MidSommar as much as I appreciated its audacity and the skill that clearly went into making it. This was a stunning work of art that embraced excess with a few positive results."
    },
    {
      "text": "Is it a movie about grief, emasculation, mental health, spiritual awakening? The movie seems to inadvertently ask “Who cares? Just watch another unnerving scene where the creepy Swedish cult does something else bizarre.”"

      "text": "Aster wields a two-pronged setup that pokes at feelings of anxiety about remote communities and their link to an untamed wilderness, while also presenting characters whose interpersonal drama underscores every potently disturbing situation in the film."

      "text": "Midsommar is a waking nightmare and I mean that in the best possible way."
    },
    {
      "text": "Despite the way Midsommar is being talked about as an 'extreme', disturbing cinemagoing experience, I found it joyful and uplifting."
    },
    {
      "text": "But beyond the high-gore kills and self-hating political circumspection, Midsommar is a movie about ignoring what's right in front of you..."
    },

      "text": "...I would absolutely recommend Midsommar...a great horror film."
    },
    {
      "text": "In Midsommar, grief is accompanied by an unnerving hum: the confluence of hundreds of mourners collectively putting anguish out into the ether, as if to open up emotional veins and make the act of sharing pain almost too vulnerable an affair."

    },
    {
      "text": "I was never, even for one second, feeling the length... I found it so unsettling and sinister. At moments it was a little uneven, but it's so watchable and gets under your skin in a really creepy way."
    },
    {
      "text": "Aster is good at creating environments, but he seems more concerned with projecting himself as an intelligent filmmaker with messages full of symbols and intellectuality, than for telling a story that touches the public."

    {
      "text": "As if that were not enough, the pain management proposed by the film also leaves the director / screenwriter's point of view unbalanced. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Where Hereditary felt like two souls at odds with each other in one body, Midsommar is a work of cathartic camp."
    },
    {
      "text": "The entire cast's organic performances and Florence Pugh's masterful work of in the role of Dani makes the film one that you will never forget... Although the plot seems to stagnate at times. [Full review in Spanish]"

    {
      "text": "From the premise, the movie traps viewers and locks them in unsettling spaces through its careful form and obsessive attention to geometrical compositions and symmetries. [Full Review in Spanish]"
    },
    {
      "text": "Midsommar is a slow burn, a ruminating and sinister film that ratchets tension with a vice-like grip."
    },
    {
      "text": "Enhanced by some pointedly weird and gorgeous production design, Midsommar's meandering descent into crazy town makes for a deftly disturbing viewing experience for at least two-thirds."
    },
    {
      "text": "The restrained approach pays off and the revelations that follow make quite a shocking impact."
    },
    {
      "text": "A bad editing that leaves loose ends and simplifies the story, is compensated with the formidable production design and the ambitious intention to scare in the morning. [Full Review in Spanish]"

    {
      "text": "The culture surrounding festivals is an area ripe for horror - and MIDSOMMAR makes Fyre Festival look like a picnic."
    },
    {
      "text": "Perhaps only slightly let down by a certain inevitability about the character's fates... Midsommar is nonetheless proof of the emotional and visceral power of a well-made horror movie."
    },
    {
      "text": "What Midsommar lacks in originality, it more than makes up for with offbeat moments adorned with gut-wrenching eccentricities."
    },
    {
      "text": "Strap in for a cruel, slow ride and you'll be thinking about Midsommar long after the credits roll."

    },
    {
      "text": "The performances saved the movie, as did the amazing cinematography...it was pretty good until the third act, when it falls off the rails really fast."
    },
    {
      "text": "Indeed, it's cultural sensitivity that lies at the heart of this movie. It is not about serial killers, aliens or supernatural beings. It is about the ordinary humans we know as the Other because they come from somewhere else."
    },
    {
      "text": "A disturbing and dark tale of manipulation, alt-religion, bizarre rituals and debauchery that might just leave you aghast...Fans of 1973's classic The Wicker Man will appreciate Midsommar's respectful nods in the manner it delivers its deepest frights."
    },

    },
    {
      "text": "While Midsommar doesn't hit the highs of Ari Aster's previous film, it is still a journey worth taking."
    },
    {
      "text": "...a sun-drenched, hallucinatory nightmare that doesn't know when to end, or quite what it's trying to say, but is enormously effective (albeit inconsistently) and a giddily uneasy ride into hell."

      "text": "One of those films that makes the whole world outside the cinema seem creepy and weird when you emerge."
    },
    {
      "text": "Appreciators of complex horror will be rewarded with another genre stand-out that addresses the fearfulness within relationships, the sound mind-frame of ritualistic practices, and the terror behind a masked religion."

      "text": "Even more than Hereditary, Midsommar lives on the edge where horror meets absurdity, prompting the kind of laughter that comes from not knowing how else to respond."
    },
    {
      "text": "Midsommar starts off strong then devolves into a muddled mess. The filmmaker hopes you're too distracted by pretty visuals, solid acting, and violence to notice that this isn't a very good movie overall."
    },
    {
      "text": "A mind-wringing, sense-zinging threat to the psyche, Midsommar marks just the second work of filmmaking prodigy Ari Aster."
    },

      "text": "Aster has found the ultimate back-channel into our primal terrors, making us suspicious of the people we would otherwise run to in a tragedy. And damn if it doesn't work every time."

      "text": "A compelling piece of folk horror."
    },
    {
